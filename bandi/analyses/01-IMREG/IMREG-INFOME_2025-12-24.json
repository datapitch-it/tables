The action leverages diverse layers of communication to inform, raise awareness, and encourage participation by stakeholders, media professionals, and citizens—especially young ones.The information measure includes: A dedicated two-tiered newsfeed delivered to local and national media and directly to citizens;Online and in-person events with stakeholders’ participation and field experts; Multimedia news coverage and successful stories on how EU Cohesion funds were used in Belgium and Italy; A specific activity targeting 2–3 high schools completes the action framework.",

            "Objective": "The CohesionCha(lle)nge project is an ambitious and forward-thinking communication campaign designed to address a critical information gap surrounding EU Cohesion Policy, particularly at the regional level. It is coordinated by Editoriale Nazionale S.r.l., one of Italy’s leading media groups, the project capitalizes on its extensive expertise in journalism and digital media to ensure the effective dissemination of information. The project’s name encapsulates the dual focus of the initiative: the challenge of making Cohesion Policy tangible and relevant to both the general public and young people, and the change it seeks to inspire by showcasing the policy's transformative impact on communities across Europe. In this regard, its background and rationale stem from the need to address critical gaps in public awareness, as evidenced by the latest Eurobarometer surveys, which reveal that many Europeans—particularly young people—are unaware of EU-funded projects in their regions and the tangible benefits of Cohesion Policy. The project will also focus on two key aspects of Cohesion Policy’s impact: its role in fostering economic development by building productive districts in less developed regions and its contribution to education and training, which strengthens human capital—a crucial driver of regional and national growth. By showcasing these dimensions, the project aims to connect policy goals to real-world benefits, making the policy’s relevance and transformative potential clear to diverse audiences.\nThe project aims to demystify Cohesion Policy, by employing dynamic storytelling, cutting-edge communication tools, and fostering collaborative dialogue to bridge the disconnect between policy and citizens’ daily lives. This way the project ensures broad outreach and engagement and that the policy is not only well-understood by the European citizens and stakeholders but also appreciated for its evolving role in addressing current and future challenges across the EU.

            "Objective": "„Cohesion heroes: Best practice and perspectives from Romania” is proposed by G4Media, a top online quality news outlet in Romania and Europuls, a top EU policies think-tank activating in Romania and Brussels.\nEver since its accession in 2007, Romania has been a net beneficiary of the EU cohesion funds. The country received EUR 89.4 billion in EU funds since 2007 and the net flow balance has exceeded EUR 60 billion.\nWhile these facts represent an undisputed argument of the benefits that the cohesion policy brought to the economic progress of Romania since its accession, not all the Romanians are aware of the positive effects. \nThroughout the project proposed, COHERO4EU we aim to first, transparently inform the Romanian general and specific target audiences about the benefits of the EU cohesion policy and second, to  increase the awareness of European funds impact. These objectives will be achieved through a series of activities: video and written content that highlight the impact in local communities, at grassroot level, of European cohesion funds, testimonials from the beneficiaries; general public and specialized public engagement, local and international events; public opinion survey and social media quizzes.\nWe aim to publish over 280 pieces of content, over 580 posts on various social media channels and to get to an estimated reach of 680.000 on social media platforms.  \nFor direct interaction and engagement with the target groups we will organize 5 offline events: local, national and international, with an estimated number of at least 310 physical participants in total.\nIn terms of sustainability, the content published in the specially created sections on the websites of G4Media and Europuls websites, will remain after the end of the project and they can be accessed without time limit. Both partners will include constantly, on the long term, updates on Cohesion Policy topics in order to keep the Cohesion Policy and its future development on public agenda.",

            "Objective": "CohesionEUSEE focuses on the journalistic coverage of EU cohesion policy in South-East Europe, with particular emphasis on Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, and Romania. \nDespite being major recipients of cohesion funds, these countries often experience underreporting or misrepresentation of cohesion initiatives. The project aims to bridge this gap by providing in-depth, multi-perspective and multilingual journalistic coverage of regional policy. The consortium, comprising five media outlets with strong expertise on EU affairs, will offer comprehensive analyses combining local, national, and transnational perspectives. This will highlight shared challenges such as regional disparities, demographic shifts, and governance quality, allowing for comparisons of cohesion measures across multiple territories. Partners will assess current and past cohesion projects, identify factors limiting their success, and offer insights into how these challenges can be overcome. Journalistic coverage will focus on social development, environmental issues, youth opportunities, transport, urban challenges and cross-border collaboration, explaining how cohesion measures address these issues. A dedicated workstream (WP4) will ensure the engagement of various stakeholders in each country, including entrepreneurs interested in EU funding. The project will also cover the ongoing debate about the future of cohesion policy, especially with regard to the evolving Multiannual Financial Framework and EU enlargement, with a focus on how these issues affect South-East Europe. \nAt least 273 editorial outputs will be produced, including articles, podcasts, videos, and social media content, targeting diverse audiences.Content will be shared across various platforms, including websites, newsletters, and social media. Field reporting and multilingual coverage will ensure a localized and broad-reaching understanding of the region’s cohesion measures, enhancing EU citizens’ engagement with the policy.\n",

By combining digital and in-person activities, it seeks to engage policymakers, public authorities at all levels, NGOs, educational and scientific institutions, municipal organizations, business representatives, youth, and other social groups.\nFocusing on the current programming period, the project highlights the significance of key Cohesion Policy Funds in Latvia, including the Cohesion Fund, European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund Plus, and Just Transition Fund. It also explores the alignment of investments in Latvia with the five priorities of the Cohesion Policy: fostering a competitive and smarter Europe, advancing a greener and more sustainable Europe, improving connectivity, promoting social inclusion, and bringing Europe closer to citizens. Additionally, the project evaluates the effectiveness and sustainability of fund allocations at national, regional, and local levels.\nThe project delivers its messages through content published in Latvian and Russian (languages extensively used in Latvia), encompassing articles, videos, podcasts, and studio discussions shared on prominent platforms such as TVNET.lv, RUS.TVNET.lv, and Apollo.lv. It includes promotional campaigns across news media, social media, and Google platforms, alongside events tailored for business representatives and the public. Gamified engagement activities and interviews with key stakeholders further enrich the initiative’s reach and depth.\nBy leveraging these efforts, the project aims to foster dialogue in between public authorities and general society, complement communication efforts, enhance understanding, and demonstrate the strategic benefits of the Cohesion Policy for Latvia’s balanced and sustainable development.",

The project focuses on countering disinformation about climate change and energy, offering reliable, fact-based information on EU actions and strategies. The goal is to reach a broad audience, particularly younger users and people from rural areas, through interactive and engaging forms of communication, such as surveys, debates, expert interviews, quizzes, and multimedia content. The project will utilize the WP portal and the Vibez platform to reach various demographic groups, including individuals aged 15-29. In addition to issues related to energy transformation, the project will also promote awareness about financial support from EU funds, particularly in the context of sustainable development and social justice. Expected outcomes include reaching 3.8 million unique users, generating over 4.3 million views of materials, and 6.5 million video plays on websites and social media channels. The project will contribute to a better understanding of EU climate and energy policies and enable citizens to actively participate in the transformation process.",

It explores intelligent public transport, European rail corridors to reduce carbon footprints, and the transfer of best practices to Slovenia, emphasizing investments in the green transition through cohesion policy. The project includes analytical research in 14 European countries comparing and testing the possibility of implementing present solutions to Slovenian practices, combining all platforms of national public broadcaster: radio, TV, web, social media, and live events.\nThe proposed project embraces 10 comprehensive TV broadcasts, 47 radio broadcasts on national and regional Radio Slovenija channels, 2 all-day on-location programmes, and public debates featuring youth perspectives on cohesion-funded sites. Broadcasters for minorities from Italy, Austria and Hungary will also air the content. We will offer the content to the EBU News Exchange, as well. Flashmob events for public transport users will offer creative insights into mobility. Online content comprises features on 10 cycling routes with interactive maps hosted on a special project website and youth-focused platforms. \nPodcasts with a broad reach and high-performing social media profiles will amplify dissemination. Accessible technologies like subtitles and sign language will ensure inclusivity. All content produced to the highest media standards will also be available after the end of the project.\nThe project aims to reach a large part of the population through a wide range of media, fostering a positive perception of sustainable mobility, aligning with EU priorities, as well as inspiring local communities and committing policymakers to action.\n",

This strategy comprises:\n\n• A radio campaign featuring 90 episodes, each 30 minutes long, on European Cohesion Policy. These episodes, produced in Spanish, Catalan, and Galician, will be broadcast on 128 local radio stations, reaching 264 municipalities in the three regions and a combined audience exceeding 2.2 million people. The campaign will focus on two primary themes: the role of Cohesion Policy in fostering jobs and growth in Europe, and its contribution to reducing disparities among Member States and regions.\n\n• Multimedia productions, including 15 videos (Reels / Short) for social network highlighting emblematic projects funded by Cohesion Policy in these regions. These videos will be integrated into a broader online communication effort, complemented by 30 professional video about Cohesion policy, 90 brief audio podcasts, and 30 up-to-date news pieces about the European Cohesion Policy's regional impact.\n\n• Three regional radio conferences, which will serve as platforms for debate and reflection on the goals, achievements, and future of Cohesion Policy. These events will feature international experts and draw at least 120 participants, primarily journalists. The conferences will be recorded and later aired on the project's radio network.\n\nThis multifaceted approach ensures wide-reaching and impactful dissemination of the European Cohesion Policy’s benefits and objectives.\n",

            "Objective": "The proposed project focuses on raising awareness of the EU's cohesion policy in the Czech Republic, particularly in structurally disadvantaged regions like Moravskoslezský, Ústecký, and Karlovarský. These regions face significant economic and social challenges, necessitating targeted communication about the benefits of EU-funded projects. Previous research shows that knowledge of local projects enhances positive perceptions of the EU; while 92% of respondents are aware of EU funds, awareness is lower in these regions (e.g., 89% in NUTS II Northwest).The project aims to produce and distribute multimedia and audiovisual materials that provide comprehensive information on the outcomes of the cohesion policy and its impact on citizens. We will use social media to facilitate open discussions about regional needs and current topics, directly addressing the call's goals of increasing awareness about cohesion policy and the Just Transition Fund.Our objectives include enhancing media coverage of the cohesion policy and increasing awareness of the benefits these projects bring. We plan to execute 24 reports on regional television, 18 press articles in the national newspaper Blesk, and radio segments on Frekvence 1. Additionally, we will collaborate with influencers, run a social media campaign, and organize press conferences and outdoor campaigns to maximize outreach.To engage younger generations, we will leverage social media and the high internet penetration rate (84% among those aged 15 and older) to disseminate information effectively. Research indicates that familiarity with specific EU-funded projects leads to more positive evaluations of their impact (positive ratings drop nearly one-third without such knowledge).Overall, this project will provide clear information about the EU's cohesion policy, promote awareness of specific regional projects, and improve perceptions of EU funds, ultimately strengthening citizens' trust in the EU and its benefits for loc. communities",

Moreover, a wide range of stakeholders will be directly involved as experts and testimonials in the production of information as well as in interactive events planned to increase the understanding of the cohesion policy relevance for local territories and promote capacity building and cross-sectorial and cross-regional partnerships. The action will focus on key topics of the cohesion policy, namely the ecological and digital transition, the demographic transition, social inclusion and innovation as a driver to address these challenges. The action is structured in five synergistic Work Packages (WPs) to enhance public understanding, engagement, and dissemination of the EU Cohesion Policy while fostering collaboration. WP1 ensures effective management and high-quality outputs. WP2 delivers accessible information through newsletters, articles, podcasts, and docuseries. WP3 showcases Puglia’s regional successes. WP4 promotes collaboration via events and labs. WP5 ensures widespread dissemination and sustainability through digital platforms, a forum, and a Manifesto for Cohesion.",

            "Objective": "\"Cohesion Shapes the Future aims to address some priorities of the new European Commission, highlighted in the political guidelines published in July 2024. In particular, our aim is to stimulate discussion on issues that are intertwined with Cohesion Policy. The Structural Funds already invest considerable resources in the competitiveness of the European economic system, both to strengthen businesses and to strengthen infrastructure. Competitiveness – also in light of the Draghi plan – has become one of the drivers of EU policies. Cohesion policy will also be asked to contribute to this collective effort. Among the political objectives of the new commission on which we would like to keep the attention high are two issues related to the European social model that \"\"does not want to leave anyone behind\"\". First of all, we are referring to the demographic changes that the Member States are experiencing, with serious social and economic consequences for families, businesses and governments. Linked to demographic changes is the phenomenon of gentrification of cities, which generates housing crises and excludes the youngest and economically weaker sections of the population. Finally, the two-year period 2025-2026 will be decisive in shaping the new post-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework. The change of strategy that is expected – resources in exchange for reforms, as for the RRF – will require a lot of media attention on the consequences that this may have on Cohesion policy in general.\"",

            "Objective": "The INTERACTIF project is a pilot communication campaign aimed at raising awareness and engaging local communities with the European Union’s cohesion policy, focusing on two cross-border regions: Piedmont (Italy) and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (France). These areas, while rich in potential, face challenges such as geographical isolation and depopulation.\n\nThe project primarily targets young people (aged 16-35), who are seen as both observers of local challenges and agents of change. By involving youth, INTERACTIF seeks to create new narratives highlighting the potential of cross-border regions and leveraging their ability to amplify messages through social networks and digital platforms.\n\nTo achieve its goals, INTERACTIF actively involves media outlets, local authorities, universities, and civil society organizations, fostering collaborations and synergies. It uses innovative and creative tools, such as digital storytelling, partnerships with influencers, and informal approaches (e.g., memes), to make communication accessible and engaging. Young people thus become ambassadors of cross-border cooperation, enhancing the dissemination of information about cohesion policy.\n\nThe project’s strength lies in the expertise of its Franco-Italian team, experienced in communication and public engagement. This expertise ensures the development of targeted and effective activities, delivering measurable results. The project also emphasizes long-term impact by inspiring similar initiatives in other European regions, contributing to a more unified and engaged Europe through better communication and cross-border collaboration. \n\nIn summary, INTERACTIF provides an innovative and scalable model for improving communication about cohesion policy in cross-border regions, promoting civic engagement, cooperation, and a shared European identity. With the potential to inspire similar initiatives, the project contributes to a more inclusive and youth-oriented communication strategy.",

The initiative addresses significant gaps in communication by countering misinformation, fostering trust, and emphasizing the transformative role of the Cohesion Policy in regional development. It proposes a comprehensive strategy involving innovative communication methods, stakeholder engagement, and capacity building for media professionals.\n\nKey project objectives include raising public awareness of the Policy's contributions to sustainable development, empowering media and communication managers to act as credible amplifiers of EU initiatives, and fostering active stakeholder dialogue. Activities will leverage tools such as video storytelling, interactive media platforms, podcasts, and tailored workshops to engage diverse audiences effectively. The project also incorporates a robust dissemination plan to ensure long-term impact, including the creation of a digital compendium of best practices and a dedicated web platform.\n\nWith partners including the Stara Zagora Regional Economic Development Agency (SZ REDA), Brand Media Bulgaria, and Television Stara Zagora, the project will directly reach over 150,000 citizens, train 50 stakeholders, and deliver high-quality multimedia content. This initiative not only aligns with EU priorities for just transitions but also serves as a replicable model for other regions undergoing significant socio-economic transformations.\"",

Harnessing its extensive reach and expertise as one of the Czech Republic’s leading media houses, VLM employs a multi-channel strategy to ensure impactful communication and engagement.\n\nKey activities include regular articals in Deník Extra, a free newspaper distributed to 1.7 million households, and in Deník, a paid daily newspaper with broad state and regional coverage with readership of 1.9 million readers (officially measured in Q3/24). These publications will feature targeted content on EU-supported projects, emphasizing their role in fostering regional development and improving community quality of life.\n\nComplementing the print strategy, VLM intensifies its online reach through denik.cz, one of the country’s top online news platforms with over 4 million real monthly users. Weekly digital articles and multimedia content, including photos and videos, will spotlight EU contributions, catering to regional preferences and themes.\n\nAdditionally, the initiative reinforces community engagement through educational outreach. Capitalizing on VLM's collaborations with leading Czech universities, the project incorporates a series of lectures and workshops devoted to EU-related topics. These sessions aim to engage students and young professionals, fostering informed discussions and deeper understanding.\nThrough these focused actions, the \"\"Europe Closer to Home\"\" seeks to bridge the information gap, combat misinformation, and inspire public trust in EU policies. By leveraging both traditional and digital media alongside academic forums, the project creates a well-rounded approach to enhancing public awareness and appreciation of EU contributions.\n\"",

            "Objective": "\"The \"\"EUconomy – Partnerships4Prosperity\"\" project underscores the vital role of EU cohesion policy in fostering economic development and promoting social inclusion. By focusing on concrete, cross-border initiatives, the project highlights how European integration benefits local communities while strengthening democratic values. By investing in structurally weak regions, cohesion policy not only promotes economic participation but also enhances trust in democratic processes. Through authentic storytelling and accessible content, our initiative brings these benefits to life. Each of the ten planned content packages includes a video, a concise article providing detailed insights, and three targeted social media posts. These are crafted with authenticity, featuring interviews with individuals affected by or involved in the projects, and are complemented by infographics and animations. Thematically, the project covers diverse areas such as sustainability, innovation, vocational training, and digital transformation. It spans regions in Germany and neighbouring countries like Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and France, showcasing both completed and ongoing initiatives. This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the EU's role in fostering regional development. Social media is a cornerstone of the project’s outreach strategy. By employing short, engaging video snippets and visually appealing formats, the initiative effectively reaches younger audiences, making the complex topic of cohesion policy more relatable and accessible. We utilize the services of dpa's division news aktuell, including dissemination via ots and presseportal. These tools, combined with partnerships with European news agencies, enable us to achieve significant reach and impact. To conclude the project, a hybrid press event will be held in Berlin and streamed online. This event will highlight the project’s achievements, featuring a panel discussion.\"",

            "Objective": "The Youth4EU project fosters public awareness of the EU Cohesion Policy through the implementation of local, grassroot reach out actions, from a 1000 network of full time youth EU mobility volunteers,  as well as existing and foreplaned major national and international events, enabling to pass a message therefore countering rising Euroscepticism, raising awareness of the benefits and functioning of the Cohesion Policy, and fostering greater trust and engagement among citizens.\n\nThe initiative led by the Collective for a European Civic Service in a consortium of five countries/6 partners will include two main pillars of action:\n\nFirst, the consortium will enhance the visibility of the Cohesion Policy through its direct implication in major national events (Berlin Conference, Karpacz Economic Forum, Lust In Sarreguemines Franco-German festival, Youth Peace Forum during Milano Olympic Games). These gatherings will feature the partners and European Civic Service volunteers who will animate dedicated spaces for discussions and presentations, alongside influential stakeholders such as regional decision- makers and policymakers. Professional media coverage will amplify the outreach, ensuring the message resonates beyond the immediate event context.\n\nSecond, the project will deploy grassroots communication strategies to engage the public directly. Teams of young European volunteers from our consortium of youth organisations, trained as “changemakers,” will organize monthly public sessions across France, Germany, Italy, and Poland – representing a total of at-least 100 workshops. These activities will highlight the tangible impacts of EU-funded projects towards those underserved communities. By empowering these volunteers as ambassadors for EU policies, the initiative aims to inspire a new generation of Europeans to appreciate and advocate for the benefits of the Cohesion Policy and make them long term sustainable relays.",

Alongside, the project team aspires to inform people about the fact that Cohesion Policy contributes to the promotion of a more inclusive, sustainable, green, connected and closer to the citizens European Union. Additionally, during the project implementation, a set of activities to be implemented aim to bring together not only relevant stakeholders at local, regional, national and EU levels but also academia, businesses and citizens to discuss about the Cohesion Policy's future.\n\nTo this end, a comprehensive awareness raising campaign will be implemented through the use of new and traditional media as well as the\norganisation of a set of different events. Thus, throughout the project lifespan, various content will be produced and distributed such as: a web-tv show, online publications, posters, and social media posts. The goal of the campaign will be to inform people about\nCohesion Policy's crucial role in the improvement of EU citizens lives without leaving anyone and any region behind. Additionally, a series of events (i.e. focus groups, open discussions) will be implemented in order for the project to engage with both relevant stakeholders and people and make them participate in a discussion on Cohesion Policy and its future. Last but not least, the Cohesion Policy will be promoted through gamified experiences.",

            "Objective": "The successful transition towards a climate-neutral economy must ensure reduction of inequalities, creation of net employment effect with new high-quality jobs, while strengthening competitiveness. Therefore, the support that the EU Cohesion policy and Just transition fund provide for the territories most negatively impacted by the transition, in particular coal-mining regions, is crucial for diversifying and revitalizing their local economies and in creating sustainable employment opportunities for impacted workers. \nTransition opportunities for jobs creation and career development (TOP JOBS) will produce and disseminate information and content linked to EU Cohesion policy results and opportunities for creating new jobs and ensuring sustainable development of the labor market in the regions. The project will emphasize the numerous opportunities for employment, jobs creation, entrepreneurship, and up-skilling, which CP and JTF are bringing and will continue to create in the country and the three Bulgarian coal regions. In doing so, the project will address the main concerns of the residents related to rising unemployment rate, increasing poverty and declining professional opportunities for younger generations, which may cause rising depopulation in these regions even before the coal phase-out. Under the project, 7 public regional events and large-scale communication campaign will target local stakeholders and citizens. The events will raise awareness on the invaluable contribution of EU`s financial instruments in ensuring the greening of the European economy in a fair and inclusive way to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities, and leaving no one behind.  BMB will involve more than 2600 residents of the 3 BG regions in a dialogue for their future using innovative communication instruments. The result will be increased acceptance of the Green Deal & skills and capacity of local stakeholders to contribute to sustainable development of the regions.\n",

The project includes a web series of video documentaries aimed at the national public; long-form articles; a social media campaign crossing both national and local audiences; a series of capacity-building live webinars for local administrators. Corriere.it's unmatched platform for communicating to the national Italian public will deliver Somewhere Studio's character-driven documentaries and social media stories. Somewhere Studio will bring to a next level, in this way, the experience developed with \"\"Crescere in Europa\"\", its recent Infome project that was able to reach 1,3 million people with personal stories of EU co-founded activities. The Rivincite web series on Corriere.it will present real, living examples of how EU Cohesion policy can impact lives and territories, allowing a wide reach (thanks to video, the main type of content search by online audiences), an identification process and an approach that entertains and informs. The documentaries will focus on stories of social inclusion and regional development supported by Eu Cohesion policy. “Rivincite” and “il Corriere della Sera” will publish the documentaries and their related in-depth informative articles in a row of 10 consecutive Sundays, while social media engagement will be kept across project's duration. Alongside the publication of the web series and the social media contents, Somewhere Studio will host on Crescere in Europa's profile 10 live webinars with European funds' experts, aimed to a selected groups of local administrators and community stakeholders of the territories involved in the stories, to translate the stories into case studies for capacity building and knowledge sharing on Eu Cohesion funds' opportunities.\"",

            "Objective": "The Cohesion4(E)U aims to effectively support and enhance the dissemination of information related to the EU Cohesion policy by employing a multifaceted approach to deliver accurate, comprehensive, and engaging content that illustrates the significance of Cohesion policy in achieving the EU's priorities and addressing current and future challenges for the EU, its Member States, its regions and the local level. Therefore, our project's mission is to serve as a dynamic and inclusive platform for facilitating a deeper connection between Cohesion policy and the communities it serves, thereby fostering a sense of ownership, collaboration, and participation. We will inspire and engage a wide spectrum of audiences, from the general public to stakeholders, including NGOs, businesses, beneficiaries, and academic and public authorities.  To create a better understanding of and engagement with EU Cohesion policy, the project will encompass a series of activities such as online media activations including infographics, social media campaigns, podcasts, e-banners, online polls, online articles, and a vlogging series; traditional media activities such as TV and radio spots, reportages, radio interviews, and printed press; dissemination events including a networking session, tour events, and themed events for young people aligned with the five goals of Cohesion policy, as well as interactive installations in public spaces to create immersive educational experiences for citizens, launched through a festival. Therefore, the project anticipates showcasing the tangible impact of Cohesion policy on local communities, cultivating a positive opinion among EU citizens as well as garnering increased support, leading to stronger advocacy and collaboration in Cohesion policy implementation. By fostering engagement and information-sharing, the project seeks to contribute to the broader discussion on the future of Cohesion policy and thereby of Europe.",

            "Objective": "Though popular awareness of the EU Regional Policy has improved recently, there is still room for improvement in the EU's general understanding and appreciation of the Cohesion Policy. This context is characterized by: low perception of the impact of the EU policies, skepticism towards the EU, communication bottlenecks. Since 2021 the awareness of the ERDF and CF has decreased at EU level (49% in 2021 vs 46% in 2023). AWARE will produce and distribute content and information, raise knowledge of and lessen skepticism about the EU Cohesion Policy, and improve media professionals' ability to communicate throughout Europe in order to maximize the effectiveness of communicating CP-related contents. More specifically, AWARE aims at:\n1.Promote cooperation between media professionals and specialists (such as companies, associations, advertising agencies, and newspapers) to develop standards for communicating the Cohesion Policy in Europe in an efficient manner that takes into consideration national variations.\n2.Through a variety of online content platforms, enhance citizens' contact and participation at the national and regional levels regarding the benefits of the EU's Cohesion Policy. One such platform is an information box that is presented on Fanpage.it’s homepage, two video-educational, three video-reportage, and three podcasts with video components.  The videos will be available with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish in addition to Italian.\n3.Showcase 7 initiatives that won REGIOSTARS awards between 2021 and 2027 to highlight the significance and integration of regional development. To achieve this 4 info-galleries will be created by Geopop and 3 branded and 3 Instagram pieces will be shared via Fanpage channels.\nThe selection of the formats has been tailored to the characteristics of the online users (educational level, typology of news preferred and age) as well as media stakeholders.",

            "Objective": "\"European funds? In the Czech Republic they are, and are not. Except for signs on construction sites saying \"\"With financial contribution from the EU\"\", specialised websites like DotaceEU.cz and the technical work of the state administration, it is as if EU funds do not exist. However, they do exist, but somewhere \"\"in between\"\" - thanks to the awareness of subsidies the Eurosceptic Czech Republic moved two years ago into the ranks of Member States that perceive EU membership positively as a whole. However, there are still sections of society including media that perceive EU funds as a threat to the economy or a bogeyman for municipalities and companies with too much administration.\n\tCzech News Agency (CTK), based on everyday practice and its media and non-media partnership capabilities, wants to change this situation. In the spirit of Call IMREG-2023-INFOME, CTK is calling on its own and external professionals and chosen partners to \"\"Let's talk about the funds\"\". Not theorise, really discuss. In live talks in selected cities, with local governments, companies and entrepreneurs, with the media and citizens. Let's talk about what the funds were, are and can be for. Let's show the undecided how the EU offer has been taken up by others and elsewhere, popularise the funds by competing for the best projects in cooperation with the Union of Towns and Municipalities and the Representative Office of the European Commission in Prague. Let's draw the listeners into the topic through podcasts by the recognized expert Petr Zahradník, and bring together all the created media outputs on one publicly accessible portal. Let’s provide people with an app that delivers \"\"funds\"\" to their smartphones, publicize it all on the radio.\n\tIt probably won't all be perfect, if only because we are taking a new approach to the issue of cohesion policy. If there is no debate about this, we can start one. It is worth a try.\n\"",

The project will also focus on the Next Generation EU programme, and within that the RRF.\n\nThe project will segment target audiences in both Hungary and in neighbouring countries where a significant Hungarian speaking community is present in current Member States, such as Slovakia and Romania, as well as for current candidate countries, Serbia and Ukraine. This will allow project partners to convey messages effectively to target audiences and maximise impact.\n\nThe cooperation between Portfolio.hu and Euractiv will provide citizens with up-to-date information about the impact of Cohesion policy and aims at increasing the number of Hungarians (and Hungarian speaking communities) who have a solid knowledge about Cohesion Policy and its impacts, as well as improving media coverage on the impacts and future of Cohesion Policy in Hungary and Hungarian speaking communities, as well as in Brussels. These efforts will also be complementary to Euractiv’s activities to inform stakeholders in Brussels about the achievements of Cohesion policy in Hungary and its contribution to the green transition.\n\nAn analysis will be done on the contribution of EU funding instruments (including Cohesion policy and ERDF) to implementing the European Capitals of Culture programme, as well as the results of the ‘Conference on the Future of Europe’ and the European Citizens Panel. Questionnaires will allow the project to tailor its communication strategies, educate the audience, gather stakeholder insights, measure impact, and contribute valuable data to policy discussions. Based on inputs from stakeholders, policy recommendations will be formulated on the future of Cohesion policy and the next MFF.",

            "Objective": "The MEET EUROPE project stems from the need to raise awareness of the achievements of the European Cohesion Policies in the Ecological Transition process and the impact generated on citizens' lives. Our proposal includes:\n• an annual educational project aimed at pupils in Classes III, IV and V of Secondary Schools, involving more than 2,500 students (i.e. around 50 high schools nationwide). The project is part of a three-year educational plan called GEA EDU (by the Green Economy Agency), which will begin its third year in the 2024/25 school year (December 24 - May 25);\n• a dedicated dissemination initiative, divided into three phases:\no the presence in at least 100 'special pages' (editorial and advertising), created with the help of the young people, which will be conveyed to at least 20 daily newspapers on national, regional and provincial pre-purchased space, with an estimated readership of 6.5 million for each publication;\no a strong digital promotion initiative\no attendance at 6 national visibility events organized on specific topics\nThe educational paths on EU cohesion policies are presented to young people (who will vote in 2024) with workshops by their teachers, who are provided with a multimedia teaching kit, usable in digital and traditional modes. Each month the classes will submit outputs in which they will explain what they have learnt to the adults. Withub’s journalists will integrate these works into ‘special pages’ and advertising to be published for a fee in newspapers and to be distributed on our editorial properties (e.g. Eunews and Green Economy Agency). Selected classes will be invited to participate in events attended by Italian and European institutions.\nThe project aims to create thousands of ambassadors who will spread the meaning of the cohesion policies in the ecological transition and their effects on the individual territories to other peers, teachers, family members and 'citizens'.",

The project enhances quality journalism at regional and local levels, strengthening media plurality and credibility. It supports independent media by creating a diverse, secure platform for media professionals, promoting editorial collaboration and audience engagement. EmpowerHun also tackles disinformation and propaganda, boosting access to trustworthy journalism to raise public awareness about the cohesion policy's impact.\nThe project comprises four core activities. WP 2 facilitates the ongoing exchange of information on cohesion policy debates among Hungarian journalists and media outlets. WP 3 enhances journalist capacity through Brussels study visits, providing deep insights into EU dynamics and policies, accompanied by training, mentoring, and tutoring throughout the project. The last two work packages focus on collaboratively producing media content, including 'Cohesion Stories' and investigative journalism highlighting the peripheral regions of Hungary. These activities aim to increase public awareness of the cohesion policy's effects on citizens' lives. EmpowerHun primarily targets independent journalists and media outlets across Hungary, reaching out to citizens unfamiliar with EU activities. It seeks to foster long-term, sustainable understanding of EU policies among journalists and Hungarian citizens.",

            "Objective": "Building on previous experience with the communication activities in the Regional Policy, the proposed project will employ multi-channel, multimedia communication measures to produce and disseminate information on the EU Cohesion policy, its funding mechanism, and its implementation at the national level. The proposal combines production and distribution of online content, cooperation with media (including print newspapers), social media content, events, and supporting communication and dissemination measures.\nA strong consortium of 5 partners will implement the project: EURACTIV.sk, an online news and policy portal that covers the EU Cohesion policy for more than 20 years, Association of Towns and Communities of Slovakia (ZMOS), the largest association of the the municipalities with 2784 members, Association of Self-governing Regions (SK8) that brings together all eight Slovak self-governing regions, publishing house of the major Slovak daily Dennik N (N Press), and the Technical University of Kosice (TUKE) with its Department of the Regional Policy. This combination of media (EURACTIV.sk, NPress), stakeholder associations (ZMOS, SK8), and academic institutions (TUKE) are well-suited to reach wide and diverse target groups and create synergies for efficient and effective communication of the EU Cohesion policy. \nNumerous crises the EU faces could derail the successful implementation of the EU Cohesion policy. This underlines the importance of coherent, objective, and comprehensive information on the policy, regional development in general, and its environmental, social, and economic aspects. The mix of proposed communication activities (online multimedia content, cooperation with media, events, and engagement activities) will build trust, increase the engagement of the target groups, and support the quality of the quality and relevance of the public policy debates, including by addressing misconceptions and disinformation.",

According to the findings of the 2023 Eurobarometer 531 only 35% of the Cypriots knew at least one project in their area that was funded by EU funds. Our objective is to help citizens associate themselves with Cohesion Policy and help them to be actively involved in the debate about the future of the Policy.\n\nOur project builds on the positive experience gained by the project \"\"Cohesion is us\"\": We maintain our partnership, composed of 3 national media (TV, Radio and online news), a company specialised on EU information campaigns and a Foundation with strong links to the local authorities and the society and we are now adding more content and more interaction with our audiences, aiming not just to inform, but to mobilise citizens and stakeholders for actively discussing the future of the Cohesion policy.\n\nWe designed a project with two main components: information to help citizens understand Cohesion and its impact on their everyday lives (media news, websites, podcasts, publications) and engagement to help citizens and stakeholders express their views and ideas for the future of the Cohesion policy (seminars, interactive events, contests, public consultations).\n\nDuring the 12 months of implementation, we will provide sustained coverage to Cohesion with dedicated slots at mainstream TV and radio shows and in one of the most prominent news webpages. We will offer news reportages and articles (TV, radio, online), podcasts, multimedia stories, 1 modular movie on Cohesion, seminars for professors and teachers, online consultations, blog posts, contests, extensive social media exposure and an event that will connect Europe day with Cohesion.\"",

Gli obiettivi principali del progetto sono:\n• Promuovere e facilitare una migliore comprensione del ruolo della politica di coesione nel fornire sostegno a tutte le regioni dell'UE;\n• Migliorare la consapevolezza dell'impatto che la Politica di Coesione ha sullo sviluppo del territorio, evidenziando lo stretto legame tra i fondi comunitari, nazionali e regionali;\n• Stimolare l'interesse e lo spirito di iniziativa dei cittadini attraverso la diffusione di storie di successo regionali ed europee realizzate con i fondi della politica di coesione;\nIl progetto promuove azioni di comunicazione sulle le politiche di Coesione sia a livello nazionale che a livello regionale (Sicilia) attraverso lo Sport e con il mondo sportivo coinvolgendo anche la cittadinanza.\nPrincipali attività:\n• Campagna di comunicazione attraverso lo sport che si svolgerà sia a livello regionale (Sicilia) che nazionale, e avrà come testimonial due squadre di basket femminile (Famila Schio Veneto in serie A1 e Verga Basket di Palermo in serie B)\n• Mostra itinerante presso palazzetti dello Sport, Palestre,centri Sportivi e nelle Scuole.

Sustainable challenges are becoming the focus of society, particularly in Germany and its neighbouring countries.\nThe \"\"EU4regions\"\" project will produce high-quality multimedia and journalistic information on cohesion policy and then disseminate it widely. Within 12 months, we will report on Interreg projects from western and eastern Germany and neighbouring countries/regions to highlight local challenges. The countries concerned are Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and Denmark. \nOur thematic focus is on sustainability, whereby we understand sustainability as a whole. Although climate issues are at the centre of attention, they are complemented by economic and social aspects. The aim is to use personal stories and insights to show how EU cohesion policy affects regions and people.\nThe project involves the production and distribution of 13 content packages in German and one other language. 12 content packages relate to specific Interreg projects from Germany and one each from a neighbouring country. One content package is dedicated to cohesion policy in general and provides basic information on questions such as: What is cohesion policy and how does it work? This content package serves as an introduction and is produced in German, in easy-to-understand language (German, level A2) and in English and distributed in 8 countries. \nOur content strategy includes a multimedia approach. Text, video and image formats will complement each other and offer the opportunity to serve different target groups. A particular focus is on the creation of social media content to appeal to a younger target group.\n\"",

This EU funding package will also be the last chance for Portugal to catch up with the Union average, since future enlargement and financial limitations, will reduce our share of EU funds. \n\nWe've structured this project, first and foremost, to reply to these challenges, with each work package looking at specific objectives:\nAfter WP1, dedicated to project management, WP2 – titled “Smarter, more competitive” - will showcase work done with the EU Cohesion Fund, namely the road to contribute to a more competitive, smarter Europe in Portugal. \n\nThem, WP3 – “Greener, mores sustainable” - will highlight the path to zero carbon economy, energy transition and a more sustainable environment, cross-referencing with the ERDF, Cohesion and Just Transition Funds.\n\nLastly, WP4 – “Closer, more social” - will bring to the public 20 projects in Portugal that best illustrate the 20 principles of the European Social Rights, created content for digital and social media platforms of Expresso, hoping to connect our readers – over 230 000 – to the priorities set by the European Social Fund+ and Just Transition Fund, working for a closer EU. \n",

            "Objective": "\"The RTV Slovenija project entitled \"\"Talents4Regions\"\" focuses on the European demographic problem, 'Talent Trap' – EU regions in the trap of underdevelopment and lacking talent. Do the regions know how to address the correct demographic issues? Is the creativity of talents rewarded? We have answers to the question: How can we stop emigration?\nThese questions focus on network media projects with various shows and channels to improve awareness about European cohesion policy and this specific topic amongst the general public, young people and decision-makers. The national television broadcaster will produce a series of 26 short shows presenting good practices from 11 European countries, which will be broadcasted on the Slovenian national television TV SLO, the Croatian national television HRT, the Bosnian television BRT TV.\nThe national radio will produce 40 shows, including two original radio plays, public concerts and podcasts. It will broadcast them on three central and regional radio channels of RTV Slovenija, posted in Italy and Austria. Concerts will be available for EBU exchange.\nPromotional events will be organised as part of the EUSAIR and Interreg projects, a digital hub in Novi Sad (Serbia) and a radio show and concert in Murska Sobota (Slovenia). \nThe RTV Multimedia Centre is committed to creating a media support network that is recognisable and accessible to all. Media support also includes promotion and dissemination on social media, with specially targeted video documentaries featuring innovative young individuals living in rural areas in Slovenia.  All content will be available on our online platform, with TV series also featured on the Agroklub platform in Croatia. Dostopno.si will provide access to the content for the deaf and hard of hearing and those who are blind and visually impaired. Enostavno.si will provide content adapted for easy-to-read and easy-to-understand.\n\"",

            "Objective": "ISPA Cohesion transcends a mere collaboration; it is a narrative unfolding in the digital space, fostering enlightenment and informed citizenship. In the dynamic realm of Spanish digital media, ISPA Cohesion emerges as a a 3-part national campaign that will be conducted by Spanish media organizations - Maldita.es, elDiario.es, and El Orden Mundial. With a collective monthly reach of 23 million and over 5 million social media followers, this alliance seeks to redefine public understanding of the EU Cohesion policy.\n\nISPA Cohesion orchestrates a symphony of impact, resonating across traditional websites and diverse social media channels.  The narrative, enriched with facts, resonates not only on media websites but across a myriad of social media platforms. A weekly cadence of newsletters and bulletins sustains engagement, while live-streamed events bring the public into the dialogue, where key stakeholders and the public engage in conversations that transcend the digital realm.  \n\nWith an strategic approach: \n- Maldita.es, renowned for its fact-checking prowess, takes the lead in the first chapter. Picture a realm where meticulously crafted articles, unraveling in attractive and simple formats the intricacies of EU Cohesion policy, flood the digital space. From climate initiatives to social funds, these articles are designed to be the beacon of clarity, ensuring the Spanish public is armed against the tide of misinformation.\n-  ElDiario takes the reins, steering the narrative towards the local landscapes shaped by EU Cohesion funds. Imagine the unfolding stories—a coal plant closure in A Coruña, a revolutionary educational program, and the metamorphosis of regions through renewable energy.\n- In the final chapter, El Orden Mundial, with a flair for geopolitical storytelling, unveils the broader canvas. An in-depth investigation peels back the layers of Europe's most unequal borders, exploring the impact of Cohesion funds on societal structures.",

If aware of this, in any region, a citizen would have the opportunity to use his knowledge power and advise the local authority where funding is needed to improve the situation in the region.  Continued reflections on how Cohesion Policy can generate the best produce desired results in all regions concerned by such skilled labour emigration are needed.\nEffective communication on Cohesion policy in different countries and contexts, especially in Balkan region with its past and current challenges, is the key factor of raising people’s awareness about the role of the European Cohesion Policy. \nThe main aim of the Project is to provide coherent, objective and comprehensive information, in order to give an accurate overall picture of the EU Cohesion policy, including inter alia the Just Transition Fund, or relevant support under the Recovery Plan for Europe or from the Technical Support Instrument. A special focus will be putted on skills as a driver for the development of the regions. Having a workforce with in-demand skills is important for long-term sustainable growth and competitiveness. It will also ensure that the green and digital transitions are socially fair and just.\nUsing media mix, the Project will illustrate and assess the role of Cohesion policy in delivering the EU’s political priorities and in addressing current and future challenges for the EU, Balkans, all regions in Bulgaria, cities and villages.\nSeveral information measures that will illustrate and assess the role of Cohesion policy in delivering the European Commission’s political priorities  in all NUTS 2 6 regions in Bulgaria as well as in cross-border regions in Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Greece, and Turkey.",

The campaign is intended to showcase real life stories where Cohesion Policy acted as a game changer in the life prospects of citizens.\n\nTV will be one of the most widely used medium in SEM’s proposed awareness campaign, (specifically the evening news time band) followed by prime-time radio. The messages will be based on real-life stories and testimonials of beneficiaries of EU Cohesion Policy funds. These communication measures will be supplemented with bus shelter digital adverts, a publication to be distributed to all households in Malta and Gozo as well as a stakeholder conference.\n\nOverall, the campaign will utilise both digital and print media, information in Maltese and English and incorporate in-person events. The latter allow for two-way communication during which target groups can have discussions with knowledgeable SEM staff, while the other outreach methods provide information to as wide an audience as possible, both to those who are internet literate or not, and Maltese or English speaking. The campaign content will insofar as possible be written in layman’s terms without too much technical jargon; further making the content accessible and engaging.  This is in line with the Clear writing initiative adopted by the European Commission.\n\nThe project’s specific objectives are:\n• To develop and implement 1 promotional campaign on the added value of Cohesion policy and its impact in Malta through a number of activities including 10 videos which will be promoted on various media channels, 1,000 radio adverts, the publication and distribution of 1 publication, and the organisation of 1 national conference. \n• To increase citizens’ awareness of the results of Cohesion Policy in Malta. \n• To coordinate and manage this project and to disseminate the project and its results through a dissemination plan.",

            "Objective": "The project European Regions: Partners for Sustainable Future is presented by a consortium combining the regional policy stakeholders (Association of the Self-governing Regions, Association of Towns and Communities of Slovakia), research (Technical University of Kosice), and media organisation (EURACTIV Slovakia), supported by subcontracted media partners. \nThe proposed project builds on the experience from previous regional policy communication projects implemented by the partners, adding innovative approaches that would incite the discussion about the future of the regional policy in the context of the EP elections, counter disinformation, and use the potential of social media, strengthening the impact of the communication actions. \nThe proposed project uses a mix of online and offline communication actions, producing and disseminating information related to the EU Cohesion policy instruments, focusing on the implementation of the new structure of EU funds. Sustained online media coverage will be combined with the publication of social media content, cooperation with regional/local and national media, public events, and innovative activities for your audience (policy hackathon). All planned actions put emphasis on the involvement of regional policy stakeholders and the public. \nThe activities target the general public, with a focus on young people, and stakeholders. Through cooperation with the network of media partners in other EU countries, communication action will reach a wider international audience. The estimated combined reach of the activities is 5M people receiving information. \nThe project will be implemented during an important phase of the implementation of 2021-27 regional funding when traditional instruments are combined with the resources. At the same time, the impacts of the Russian aggression against Ukraine have created new challenges (energy costs, refugee crisis, economic recession) that could be faced with the help of the EU funding.",

In a communication campaign that involves a group of national, regional, as well as EU media, project will show the real impacts of cohesion policy on citizens, explain links between EU political priorities and supported projects, and promote dialogue between national and regional stakeholders in order to stimulate the debate on the future of the policy.\n\nThe project involves communication activities that use power of the diverse set of media composed of leading national media brands as well as specialized media that are effectively addressing specific parts of our target groups such as EU policy professionals, national policymakers and stakeholders, or management of private and public organisations. We will address our audiences through a mix of activities that will be always tailored to their needs. The mix involves production of media content (written as well as audio-visual), promotion of the content among readers of respective media through their social media channels, and organization of various types of events that will welcome national, regional as well as local policymakers and stakeholders and make sure that their voice will be heard.\n",

            "Objective": "The European Union’s Regional Policy represents one of the most important place-based programs in the world for the distribution of wealth between regions and countries. The Cohesion Policy in Italy represents the only instrument capable of reducing territorial gaps between northern and southern regions without reducing investments in the most advanced ones. Astonishing achievements have been achieved in the last decades in the field of ecology transitions, social inclusion, economic development, and research courtesy of the structural fund investments. However, Italian citizens seem not convinced of the impact of the policy on the socio-economic fabric yet and, even worse, they are not aware of its existence, although it has been ameliorating their life for 30 years.\nTo tackle these issues, the project BRanding, Informing and Disseminating the cohesion policy to General and Expert audience (BRIDGE) has been built upon two theoretical assumptions: citizens’ awareness is a condition sine qua non to build a long-lasting engagement and traditional online awareness campaigns should be improved by adopting an entertainment approach able to inform and entertainingly educate the audience without losing editorial authority. In doing so, the project has been split into 3 fundamental pillars:\n\n1. Edutainment strategy to explain to citizens the Cohesion Policy 2021-27;\n2. Infotainment strategy to promote the results of the Cohesion Policy 2014-20;\n3. Capacity building for communication professionals to enhance online communication skills and strategies for systematically communicating the Cohesion Policy.\n\nThe 3 strategies will support the project in creating and disseminating information and contents in order to increase awareness and reduce scepticism on the EU Cohesion policy while strengthening the communication capacity of news media professionals in maximizing communication effectiveness of Cohesion Policy related contents. \n",

            "Funded under": "Information Measures for the EU Cohesion policy (IMREG)",
            "Objective": "Media coverage for Cohesion in Cyprus is rather limited. Besides some official announcements by the beneficiaries or the Managing Authority only few news items can be found that clearly mention cohesion policy. When media are reporting on the implementation of key projects they do mention the EU funding but without any more details on the level of support, programme etc. \nCitizens seem to be unaware of the impact the policy has to their lives. According to the findings of the 2021 Eurobarometer 497 only 39% of the Cypriots asked knew at least one project in their area that was funded by EU funds.\nAgainst this background the main objective of our project is to illustrate and assess the role of Cohesion policy in: delivering the EU’s political priorities, addressing current and new challenges and making sure that no region or city will be left behind. We want to support all efforts to communicate Cohesion by providing unbiased, objective, and easy to understand information to the Cypriots.\nWe will achieve this through a holistic media partnership that includes TV, radio, online media and events to ensure that targeted audiences will be approached in the best way, in the medium they prefer to consume news. In 12 months we will produce Sustained TV and online coverage of Cohesion, Multimedia, audio and online articles explainers, podcasts, music and knowledge radio contests, 3 events in Cyprus and 1 Brussels and an online library with handbooks for stakeholders.\nOur aim is to improve awareness and knowledge of the citizens and stakeholders and inspire debates on the impact and the future of the policy. Informed citizens are resistant to misinformation and active stakeholders help to shape cohesion to better address the needs of the citizens.",

            "Objective": "According to the Youth Survey 2021 report which uses data collected during several opinion surveys on European youth (16-30 years old)  shows that:\n• Young Europeans associate the EU with positive elements.\n• When asked what the EU means to them, a majority (58%) of Europeans aged 16-30 link it to the freedom to travel, work and study anywhere in the EU;\n• For 24% of young Europeans, climate change is one of the top three challenges the European Union is facing\nMedia consumption by young people is increasingly digital and 93% of young Europeans use the Internet on a daily basis. \nThe use of social networks is one of the main factors of Internet consumption among young Europeans.\nThe Will Together Across Europe project will move precisely in this area.\nWill Media is a media company with an online community of more than 2 million people, dedicated to inspiring change by generating awareness on the great issues of our time. Every month Will Media reaches over 10 million accounts altogether.\nThe Will Media community is made up of approximately 80% of young people between 18 and 35 years of age. the remaining 20% ​​are over 35 years old. 60% of the community is female.\nDuring 2022 Will Media was among the leading social media with a growth of over 450,000 followers on Instagram alone with over 1.3 billion impression.\nthe general objective of the project will be to increase young people's awareness of the impact of cohesion policies on the daily life of citizens through the use of social media, in full line with the mission and editorial line of Will Media , which feeds the debate and insights on the most important social platforms every day, in constant constructive and dynamic dialogue with the reference generations: Generation Z and Millennials.\nThis objective appears even more relevant taking into account that the knowledge of cohesion policies among young Europeans is lower than the European average according to the latest Eurobarometer data.",

            "Objective": "\"We are proposing the #Deine regionale Zukunft (#DRZ) project in order to put the EU Cohesion policy on the agenda of secondary school education in Germany. Therefore, we will develop seminars for students and implement 15 events in secondary schools all over Germany. The #DRZ events will highlight the immediate impact of Cohesion policy on the everyday lives of students and their teachers. The events will have a strong focus on the regions or communities where they take place and investigate how the Cohesion fund instruments contribute to the development of the area. On top of that, the project will reach out to teachers and other multipliers through a newly developed Train-the-Trainer workshop which will be implemented in five schools or educational institutions all over Germany and enables them to implement #DRZ events themselves. Moreover, we will develop an online REGIO learning centre and material library containing material and information for multipliers to implement own sessions on Cohesion policy in schools.\nThe #DRZ events and the online REGIO learning centre and material library will come along with extensive dissemination work among our network of schools and political foundations as well as the “Europe Direct Network” in Germany. Additionally, local media will be invited to each the #DRZ school events to increase its outreach. Guests from the entrepreneurial and the political scene will be invited to the events to discuss the role of Cohesion funding for the respective regions. The project is going to exploit the finding of the H2020 project COHESIFY that awareness and appreciation of the Cohesion policy as the central act of European solidarity can importantly contribute to the development of a European Identity and the support of the European integration process. Eventually, the project will promote youngsters’ and teachers’ constructive attitude towards European politics by motivating them to take an active role in shaping our European future.\"",

            "Objective": "The Creative Kingdom project, carried out by AWATRON and Old-Continent, two Belgian actors committed to communicate local realities at European level,   aims at producing 10 portraits in a multimedia mini-series format to highlight the emerging creative talents in Wallonia and in Brussels-Capital Region while magnifying EU-funded projects.    The project will have a 12-month duration, during which it aims to bring young French-speaking Belgians (18-40 years old) closer to the realities fostered by the European Union in their local areas. In fact, surveys show that although Belgium is recognised as one of the most European states, young Belgians do not relate to this identity and are indeed very critical of the EU. Based on this observation the Creative Kingdom series aims to offer positive, engaging and empowering content to youth in Wallonia and Brussels, while highlighting the role that European institutions play in their future.  Each episode is conceived to be distributed via different channels. Each portrait will be presented in the form of an interview (written, photo and video), shared via social networks. Once finalized, the mini-series will also be exhibited in the context of a public event and issued in the form of a special number of SIROP magazine, distributed free of charge with a print run of 3,000 copies to 100+ addresses in Belgium. National media campaigns fed by AWATRON's network and digital marketing will be simultaneously put in place to ensure a resounding response to the series.",

But awareness of the EU Cohesion Policy achievements is still low across the member states.The biggest challenge nowadays is the way people consume and spread information and how stories cut through the noise, especially among the Generation Z cohort – the future of Europe.The Cohesion Story Quest project aims to explore alternative communication approaches in creating and spreading information about the Policy. It aims to open doors to reach new audiences with authentic content, created and shared by the most impactful channel, the one of the INFLUENCERS.The outreach campaign will combine two methodologies - alternative media channels,focusing on influencer marketing and social media,as well as traditional PR and digital, to generate extensive publicity around the project.\nThe Cohesion Story Quest will launch as a storytelling tribe on wheels, gathering travel influencers, journalists and bloggers on a road trip from Bulgarian to Portugal through Poland and The Netherlands.The “cohesion tribe” will consist of people from different backgrounds,different ages,culture,geographical areas, and/or with a wide variety of interests,such as social infrastructure,education,health,sustainability, equality, etc.The “cohesion tribe” will visit key places influenced by the Policy in the past and collect stories from the people and amplify them. The collected information will be transformed into a variety of stories – social media video stories, blog posts, media articles, interviews, etc.The tribe will share live content to create real time engagement with the target audience.Through promotion,engagement and gamification,we will drive people to read, participate and share the stories both via the media and also via the channels of the influencers involved. The Cohesion Policy stories will travel online in the 4 member states and the region raising awareness and building credibility.",

Collaboration between youth organization ZA in PROTI, national television RTV Koper-Capodistria and non-governmental organisation PiNA will create and spread information about the Cohesion policy, and especially ESF+, and thus provide much-needed context to main target groups and individuals. \n\nThe project proposal is based on two successful implementations (GREEN Cohesion and GREEN Cohesion for YOUTH) and an understanding of the defined target groups. It joins communication and educational efforts, in order to inform and raise the involvement of target groups. Communication efforts will result in 20 television reportages for established TV shows, 2 new documentaries, 1 new talk show and invite 4 representatives of good practices, financed by the Cohesion policy in the widely- watched morning television show in Slovenia (Dobro jutro). Communication and media activities will also include a wide communication campaign and digital campaign on RTV MMC portal. Educational efforts will be focused on student debates and public consultations with key stakeholders. Informational material and training will be prepared for teachers-mentors, and 4 2-day national debate tournaments will be organized for elementary and secondary school students. \n\nDuring its duration, the proposed project will connect partner organizations, strengthen the understanding of cohesion policy among the target groups and enable the active participation of directly involved young people. In the long term, however, with enhanced information and an increased understanding of cohesion policy, Europeans can use their voice and knowledge to improve EU community policies, which is a key factor in the success and health of our common European democracy.",

            "Objective": "“Cohesion Weekly” aims to contribute to a better understanding of the EU Cohesion policy by European citizens thanks to a verified, neutral and popularized information campaign that will contribute to strengthening their sense of belonging to the EU. This information campaign will demonstrate how the European cohesion policy implements the EU's political priorities by being one of the main drivers of European integration, and how its operations contribute to addressing the challenges faced by the EU at national, regional and local level. France Médias Monde (FMM) and its affiliated entity RFI România propose to tackle this issue by informing European citizens about the role and impact of the EU Cohesion policy on their daily lives. In order to achieve this objective, FMM and RFI România will implement a transmedia and multilingual (FR, EN, RO) information campaign based on the production and broadcast of innovative audiovisual content to EU citizens to break down the role and impact of the Cohesion policy on their daily lives, and how it adapts to the many challenges the EU is facing by providing concrete examples of Cohesion projects in 18 EU countries, including 3 outermost regions. FMM and RFI România will carry out 3 WPs:  \n- Produce radio reports and web articles in French covering topics of EU’s Cohesion Policy such as cross-border cooperation in health, peace, energy and climate change resilience across EU and the Outermost regions (WP2)\n- Produce TV magazines, long reports and fact-or-fake modules, in French and in English, explaining the EU Cohesion policy and how it is adapting to the various challenges of the post-Covid world and the return of war on the European continent (WP3)\n- Produce radio reports, videos and infographics in Romanian to raise Romanian citizens’ awareness of the Cohesion policy, and particularly the EU Strategy for the Danube Region (WP4)\nThe results achieved by our project will potentially target 1.8 million people across Europe.",

The project will create a \"\"learning community\"\" specifically designed for the particularities and sensitivities of the citizens of these territories, carrying out communication, awareness-raising and promotion campaigns on cohesion policy using specific tools and messages for the \"\"losers\"\" of the processes of globalisation, which are the inhabitants of rural areas far from urban areas. In this way, the project will raise the visibility of cohesion policy actions, objectives, strategies, planning, instruments and funds in these territories, increasing support for the European construction process and facilitating more and better use of funds to boost sustainable growth and reduce the specific disparities. The slogan of the project will be \"\"Here we are, EU”, to emphasize the fact that the inhabitants of European territories at risk of depopulation contribute to the process of European integration and that their activities and businesses contribute to improving the quality of life of citizens in the 276 regions of the EU.\"",

(Projects Broadcasting Europe 2017-3-IT03-KA205-012236 and One Radio 2019-2-ES02-KA205-013843).\nFinally, the participants will receive training on digital tools, storytelling techniques and assertive communication, as well as strategies for effective communication and dissemination.\nOnce they have participated in the training activities, the young participants will make up their teams and divide roles and tasks to set up their web radios and Twitch channels, with the aim of identifying issues related to Cohesion policy and the Just Transition Fund, contact policy makers, civil society representatives and activists, and organize podcasts and streaming to publicize these programs and initiatives, while conducting journalistic research.\nStarting from the analysis of the needs and own competences, we have recognized the following objectives:\n\n-Value the role of European institutions and policies, with special emphasis on Cohesion policy and the Just Transition Fund\n-Promote the active participation of young people in the processes of civic monitoring and democratic life;\n-Build bridges between the business world, the educational world and that of political institutions, which allow educational exchange and improve the quality of initiatives",

            "Objective": "Cohesion policy is one of the main drivers of development, but only a small percentage of EU citizens know what Cohesion policy means and what impact it has on their lives and their environment.  Therefore we designed a strong media consortium with a greater audience reach and with an intention to produce and disseminate information linked to EU Cohesion policy and raise public awareness about its impact on their lives. \n TV Idea – kanal 10 is main TV broadaster in Pomurje and covers more than 40.000 households. Partner Mariborinfo d.o.o. with media outlets Sobotainfo.com, Mariborinfo.com, Ptujinfo.com, Ljubljanainfo.com covers specific regions in Slovenia and has a reach of more than 258.000 visitors per day and more than 1.300.000 readers per month. Styria media.si d.o.o. operates with one of the largest national online media and has an expert team of social media communication for youth generation. Žurnal24 is an informative media outlet with monthly reach of 700.000 users, Joongla operates as Youtube, TikTok and Instagram channel for younger audience (more than 58.000 Youtube subscribers). Starševski čvek is the largest online forum in Slovenia with more than 60.000 daily visitors. With project activities we will provide information about CP, enable a more informed debate about future priorities for the EU and on the way that funding should be used. General public and specific stakeholders will get a better insight on impact of Cohesion Policy and its support regarding job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth, sustainable development and improve citizens quality of live across EU regions.\nWe will implement a project from Nov 2023 until Oct 2024 and produce 24 videos – 60 seconds personal stories, 12 TV shows, 41 media outlets articles with social media posts and organise 4 events for specific target group. We will reach at least 400.000 views of press releases (digital media) and at least 50.000 views of personal stories and TV shows.",

            "Objective": "“Time4Results” is an information measure to to produce and disseminate information on the overall EU Cohesion policy in Italy, with a special attention to the new instruments of 2021-27 programming and the synergies between regional funds and the National Recovery Plan. \nIn recent years, Cohesion policy faced multiple challenges triggered by the economic consequences of the COVID pandemics and the war in Ukraine. The Cohesion framework has proven flexibility to respond to those crises while preserving the long-term and structural characteristics of its intervention.\nIn the next two years new challenges will need to be addressed, as the 2014-2020 programming will close and the 2021-2027 programming will become fully operational, with great relevance for Italian society at every level, as Italy is a top-beneficiary of both 2021-27 Cohesion funds and NGEU.\nThere are, however, major Italians’ awareness gaps concerning Cohesion and the related issues:\n•\ta general, significant, lack of recognition of the policy benefits; \n•\tdramatic low levels of understanding and appreciation of the policy from the young generations\nAgainst this background The Consortium of “Time4Results” proposes a multi-level and multi-targeted information measure with a special focus on the impact and results of Cohesion policy.\n“Time4Results” leverages on diverse layers of action to inform, raise awareness and participation of stakeholders, academics, media professionals, and citizens, especially young ones. \nThe information measure includes: a dedicated two-tiered newsfeed delivered to local and national media, and directly to citizens; academic reports; online and in-presence forums with stakeholders’ participation; multimedia tools to make complex information more accessible; activities on the ground to mobilize young citizens. To support that general approach, the measure will also provide information on the results of Cohesion policy in other EU territories, beyond the local context.\n",

Hundreds of publications in own and external media channels. \n1 public survey on citizens` level of awareness on CP & transition opportunities at regional level. It will engage citizens in assessing opportunities and reflect on positive outcomes.\n1 mapping of EU-funding supported success stories - to increase visibility of CP in project`s regions & demonstrate positive impact on citizens’ lives.\n15 podcasts - successful beneficiaries tell stories about project experience and inspire audiences to unfold potential of CP financial instruments.\nIntense digital media activity to maximise visibility of successful projects, involving local influencers in disseminating project results and green transition messages.\n3 social media challenges to engage citizens producing before and after content related to projects, thus recalling positive CP impact.

            "Objective": "The project’s broad objective is to effectively inform a wide audience about the EU Cohesion policy with: a journalism information campaign (integrated multiplatform dissemination strategy) and an awareness campaign (public events).\nDomani, the media partner, will work closely with the lead partner scientific experts, inform and communicate the project’s events through articles, editorials, insights, by means of a multi-platform dissemination strategy (printed and digital newspaper, social media). Maps and infographics will sum up the results of the debates. Social media will be used specifically to encourage a broad public engagement, on the positive impact of the projects promoted by the cohesion policy. Citizens will be involved in the debate by stories on Instagram quizzes, Twitter polls and live Facebook events featured by the cohesion policy experts and by the actors in the virtuous cohesion projects.\nFondazione Basso (FB), will manage the project and its scientific experts will build its backbone contents. FB experts will map a set of outstanding “cohesion” projects and will present them during 8 local events in 8 Italian areas (L’Europa vicina. I territori si raccontano). Stakeholders and citizens will debate, delve into the topics, raise knowledge and awareness on the EU cohesion policy results. The events will mix an evidence-based data approach and the emotional storytelling by the leading project actors or the targeted beneficiaries. The final 3-day event in Rome, Maratona Europa, at national level, will involve a wide audience in a collective and participatory mode and have a significant multiplier effect for the communication of the cohesion policy’s effects. All events will be both in attendance and streamed, to reach relevant target groups. Final reports and an e-poster, as a memento for the main cohesion issues, will sum up the beneficiaries’ perception of the ongoing EU cohesion policy and will be tools for further debates in any project to come.",

A wide range of activities such as interactive educational workshops, meetups, showing and distribution of short and long videos, audio works - radio shows, web and social media articles and journalistic articles is an idea to encourage citizens to actively participate in thinking about and getting to know the EU and Cohesion policies.The innovativeness of the project is reflected in the use and redefining of the purpose of social spaces such as cinemas in places of informing and educating citizens about the European Union. Special emphasis was placed on the participation of young people, groups of citizens and residents in rural parts of Croatia who are already finding it difficult to access information through modern technologies. \n\nThe planned activities are grouped and elaborated into four categories: WP.0. Project management, WP.1. Knowledge-sharing workshops, WP.2. Awareness raising campaign- Community interventions and active citizens and WP.3. Visibility of EU funding.\nThe implementation of the project will take place in the Karlovac County, Ličko-senjska County, Primorsko-goranska County, City of Zagreb, Zagreb County, Sisak-moslavina County, Istarska County and Zadarska County area. Part of the activities will include EU member states in the region (Central Europe) in a way that through the planned audiovisual and TV content bring the target group and the wider regional and local community examples of good practice in the preparation and implementation of EU projects, Cohesion policy and other relevant topics and their contribution to improving the quality of life of the EU citizens.",

Thus, during the project implementation, diversified content will be created, including a web-tv show with street art elements (e.g. graffiti), animation videos, posters, online publications, e-banners social media posts, podcasts, and interviews. The goal will be to make people engage with the campaign and gain valuable knowledge about Cohesion Policy and its pivotal contribution in the improvement of EU citizens' lives. Additionally, a series of events (i.e. workshops, living labs and focus groups) will be implemented in order for the project to engage with both relevant stakeholders and people and make them participate in an open discussion on Cohesion Policy, its priorities and its future. A report will be drafted at the end of the events, including the results, considerations and ideas collected in all three partner regions.",

Thus, this sustainable, measurable and value-for-money Action will:\n\n\t• raise awareness among the general public, opinion formers and stakeholders from government and the Regions about the EU’s impact on people’s lives through Cohesion projects;\n\t• highlight benefits particularly for the Regions;\n\t• foster public debate on the EU’s priorities that directly affect its peoples and the future challenges it faces;\n\t• stimulate citizen participation in the public discourse on all matters EU; and\n\t• counter the claim that the Union is merely a distant bureaucratic Leviathan.\n",

            "Objective": "\"The main objective of the project is to raise awareness about the impact of the European Cohesion Policy and the impact of its effects on everyday quality of life among the part of Polish society, that is the least aware of this impact (elderly people, people living in small towns, people with maximum secondary education), in particular in terms of impact in their immediate vicinity (region and the local community).\n \nThe goal will be achieved by:\n\n1. Annual cross-media editorial campaign \"\"Stop exclusion of seniors\"\" using elements of intergenerational education and “Crosswords with European funds” reaching nearly 473,000 monthly press readers aged 55+; 4.5 million radio listeners aged up to 39,\n\n2. Dedicated press supplements \"\"Get know your region - stay around\"\" describing the possibilities of using various social services as well as the cultural and entertainment offer in immediate surrounding and region, which will be contacted by over 7 million readers and 400 thousand unique users,\n\n3. Regional, cross-sectional press publications across the country \"\"EU cohesion policy in your region\"\" which will be contacted by over 7 million readers,\n\n4. Videos carried out in cooperation with an influencer (recognizable editor) focused on increasing awareness of practical solutions offered by EU funds, which can have a real impact on improving the socio-economic situation of the project target groups.\n \nThe objectives of the project and its activities are relevant to this \"\"Call” by focusing on:\n\n1. Building awareness of EU Regional Policy among the least aware groups,\n\n2. Showing the impact of the EU Cohesion Policy in the immediate environment, applying the effects of using EU funds in everyday activities,\n\n3. Emphasizing the fact that the presence of EU funds and its effects in Poland have a real impact on the quality of life and the socio-economic situation of groups that are unaware of this impact and they are at the same time the most vulnerable on economic crisis.\"",

By definition, these areas are the most deprived in terms of primary services (like transports, schools, health), with essential public administrative functions that have been relentlessly reduced in the last two decades and difficulty in grasping information and opportunities descending from the European Union. \nWe will activate three onsite and online EU Antennae for information and advice on EU cohesion policies and opportunities. The project foresees robust information on EU cohesion policies and opportunities, disseminated through emails, mobile apps or videos, which are continuously amplified through social networks and other promotion material. Twenty training courses are provided on EU policies and opportunities. Awareness raising and public discussion in EU cohesion policies affecting peripheral areas is stimulated through the existing EU mountain forum, where Mayors participate also in the direct promotion of EU policies and opportunities.",

            "Objective": "\"\"\"The Newsroom 27\"\" is a unique European journalistic initiative aimed to draw-up a panorama of EU cohesion policy, by bringing together 27 young journalists from across the EU. For 27 days, they will build a trans-European ephemeral newsroom, look for emblematic initiatives developed throughout the Union, and write 27 articles that will be published in three languages.\n\nOur goal: \nWe want to contribute to a better understanding by European citizens of what the EU cohesion policy is, its impact on the life of their region and on their daily lives, and raise their awareness of the importance of this policy. \nOur initiative targets the 25-49 year olds, a public directly concerned by the effects of European policies, in the short, medium or long term.\n\nThe way to achieve it: \nTo enable the general public to grasp the stakes of European policy, we will tell them these stories they don't know: How the Union has helped transform the department where they live? How has this neighbor been able to develop this project to safeguard the environment? How were these scientists supported in their research project?\n\nWe will launch a call for applications, open to all young European journalists under 30. The 27 selected journalists will join The Newsroom 27, our ephemeral trans-European newsroom. \n\nThe 27 articles will be published on 3 media: \n- on our mainstream website Slate.fr, in French\n- on the website Thenewsroom27.eu, in 3 languages: french, native language of the journalist and english\n- and on a European media partner, in the local language, or on a French media partner, depending on the region covered by the article. \n\nOur media plan aims at amplifying the diffusion of contents to our target audience, through four axes: \n- at the national level in France (Slate.fr)\n- at the regional level in France (online regional press) \n- at the European level (local media)\n- on social networks\n\nEstimated impact:\n12.5 million impressions in France\n12.5 million impressions in Europe\"",

            "Objective": "A Brave New Europe - Voyager is a slow journalism project, available on different platforms. The goal is to reach and engage communities as diverse as possible, to correctly inform about the measures of the European cohesion policy, their effects, and how these measures impact people's life.\n\nThe audiences of these contents will be invited to converse and interact with the Slow News editorial team that coordinates the project, to consolidate the bond with interested people, and consolidate the relationship of trust and transparency which is the basis of good journalism.\n\nLong-forms, videos and digital stories disseminated in different formats, comic journalism, podcasts and radio programs, interactive maps, newsletters, live and on demand events are part of the editorial project.\nA Brave New Europe - Voyager is based on what we have learned and on the foundations built in previous editions of the project, with which we won the similar grant (A Brave New Europe in 2021, A Brave New Europe - Next Generation in 2022). Also in this edition we add partners and formats for disseminating content, always choosing them on the basis of common values and to reach a varied audience.\n\nA Brave New Europe - Voyager therefore integrates the experience and communities of Slow News and Percorsi di secondo welfare (working together since 2021) with those of Internazionale (an historical Italian weekly magazine), Zai.net (free press for young people, also written by students) and the Revue Dessinee Italia (an innovative quarterly based on comics journalism). This year there will also be an historic Italian radio (Radio Popolare) and an international dissemination of contexts and perspectives thanks to Le Grand Continent, which will translate, adapt and disseminate content in French, German, Spanish and Polish.\n\nLast but not least, A Brave New Europe - Voyager has another objective: to consolidate a working method where all the people who collaborate feel safe and respected.\n",

            "Objective": "\"EUFACTORNEXT aims to inform citizens and increase their awareness on the role of cohesion policy in regional development and in improving their quality of life.\nThe project will develop from the Emilia-Romagna area but have a national and European character: the dissemination of communication products will involve the entire national territory. Furthermore, the European stories (WP2 \"\"Euro-Rail\"\"), produced by young journalists in 8 EU countries, give the project a wide and interconnected character.\nThe project includes various communication activities with diversified tools. In particular, some activities (Euro-Rail -WP2, Cohesion Pills -WP 3-4) envisage different means of communication to bring the same contents to different targets: local TV /radio are aimed at all citizens, while podcasts, social media, and web are aimed rather at a younger audience. Other activities, such as the RadUni podcasts (WP4), specifically target university students. Finally, the events (WP5) have above all the objective of actively involving stakeholders, in particular businesses and young people, in the debate on the role of cohesion policy and on the future of Europe. Furthermore, the target enterprises will actively participate in all phases of the project, mostly constituting the subject of the narration and it will be directly involved.\nThe partnership already consolidated and tested by the EU FACTOR project, the variety of tools used (TV, radio, podcasts, social media, web sites, online and face-to-face events), the use of effective dissemination networks, such as the Europe Direct network, they are the best guarantee of success of the project.\nThe main expected results are: an increased knowledge and awareness of the people reached; an increased awareness of companies to be able to develop projects; dissemination of good practices, starting from virtuous projects and territories; an active participation of businesses and young people in the debate on cohesion policy and Europe.\"",

            "Objective": "Youth for green Euro Regio Future is a personalized, multilingual, online and off-line Euroregional communication campaign project on EU cohesion policy. It is created by and for youth and built upon the long-lasting territorial cooperation between the 3 member regions of the Euroregion Pyrenees Mediterranean/EPM (Region Occitanie /FR, Generalitat of Catalonia and Government of the Balearic Islands /ES). By a consortium of 6 partners representing governments, local entities, universities and youth entities from the EPM territory and experienced hosting structures of EU communication networks, Y4 GREEN ERF tackles the 5 priorities of the 2021-2027 Cohesion Policy to enhance people's awareness of EU regional policy results and impact on citizens’ lives and on the Euroregional territory’s sustainable development. The campaign’s main focus is on the greener Europe priority: the EPM has 35 land, marine and coastal natural areas. Its main target is young people including those with fewer opportunities (vocational training, second chance schools or young migrants).\nY4-GREEN-ERF, through a network of proximity media, original and wide communication channels (mini-documentaries, picture videos, social networks) adapts to a Euroregional approach the most relevant themes of the European Green Deal (adaptation to climate change, preservation of the environment and biodiversity…), subjects that go beyond borders and capitalizes the existing best practices.  \nThe project actions to be implemented, complementing the EPM Road Map 2021-2030, will be co-constructed in a bottom up dynamics and adapted to the reality of each territory of the EPM, using its 4 different languages (Catalan, Spanish, French, Occitan). Off line, at least 15 Euroregional events and a Euroregional Youth Forum are planned.\nY4-GREEN-ERF expects to impact 50,000 Euroregional citizens and directly involve 1,000 young people, taking advantage of the recently created Euroregional Youth Assembly.",

The developed content will inform citizenry and civil society organizations about the objectives, the functioning and practical results of Cohesion policies and related funds, contributing to reducing the gap existing between European institution and citizenry. \nSpecific case studies will dig into Italian projects funded by 2014-2020 Cohesion funds and their impact and will aim at promoting an approach to the production, dissemination and reading of data and information related to the use of EU funds and the effects on citizens life. They will be told by journalists starting from technical data available on the Monithon platform as collected by citizens themselves through civic monitoring activities. Under the supervision and coaching of info.nodes, young journalists will exploit data journalism and storytelling methods to develop and adapt that content for the large public. Data will speak further also through onData experience in infographics and data visualisation. The communication approach from citizens who collected data to citizens who will read and listen their stories will be further developed also through a podcast which will be led by ActionAid IT, exploiting its experience in large public communication which is centred around people and their stories of change.",

            "Objective": "The power of an argument in general increases proportionate to its persuasiveness based on clearly evident logical precepts. This seems to be an obvious and self-evident statement, although it is not. Especially in the field of mass-media one gets the impression that especially in the last decades – more than ever before – Machiavellian principle of ends justifying the means became the ruling principle. One only needs to call into its mind the ever-growing flood of fake-news, which is getting something of a new normality not only in the social media, but, unfortunately, also in the mainstream media. Thus, it does not come as a surprise that among the best rated media products are TV documentaries as the audience still trust the information, provided in these documentaries, to be the most valid and true. Therefore, the decision to present the case of the most distinguished projects executed with the help of the EU Cohesion funds in the three countries of Pannonian basin in the format of documentary films comes only as something reasonable and well-deliberated. A very powerful tool against any potential claims that such documentaries may serve only to support biased and overly positive-propagandistic views toward EU and its funds is compounding and intertwining not only one or two isolated cases but rather numerous and various proofs of all the benefits resulting from the project that were co-financed with the help of the Cohesion funds. Experts’ survey based on pure economic parameters measuring the effectiveness and social-benefits of the spent EU Cohesion funds in these three countries (Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia) will serve as an affirmation of our claim written down in the first sentence. The common denominative extrapolated from these facts – EU Cohesion funds have brought many benefits to the citizens of the EU - will be presented to the general audience of a few million viewers in a series of carefully scripted documentaries.",

Furthermore, we aim to involve equally and actively all parts of society, from Public Administrations, to private companies, from civil society actors, to private citizens. \nWe will act with a bottom-up approach, beginning with small municipalities, which are the vast majority in Italy, and thanks to our iper-specialised network we plan to spread the experience to the entire regional territory, and nationally wide after project ending.\nDYNAMIC puts into good use past H2020 Coesify and Perceive experience, data and recommendations and National Agency of Territorial Cohesion survey on degree of knowledge of Cohesion Policies results, in order to build on solid bases new, innovative and lasting solution, exportable not only in Other Italian Regions, but in most of other EU territories.\n",

Its success is key to implement EU’s political priorities .\n\nFrom a public perspective Cohesion policy is an area where the EU’s impact on daily life of millions of citizens can be manifested and measured. This is especially true in case of those who live in rural or remote areas.\n\nThe basic objective of our project is significantly increase citizens’-centred cohesion media coverage using local and regional communication channels assisted by the use of the 8th Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion of the European Commission released in March 2022.\n\nThe project involves nine EU regions, carefully selected based on development categories of the 8th Cohesion Report. Our target group is primarily composed of practising journalists working for local and regional media in 4 net contributing (DK, DE, IT and NL) and 5 Cohesion Fund net beneficiary countries (BG, HU, HR, RO and SK). The two Cohesion Field Visits together with participation at the EWRC will furnish them with the necessary knowledge and information to be effective “ambassadors” of Cohesion policy on local and regional levels. The ultimate result of the project is a significantly increased media coverage on Cohesion policy issues what would enhance public awareness of the results in this important EU policy field. The whole process is based on a changed mentality and perception of local journalists towards Cohesion policy issues.\n\nThe outreach of the project is realistic: the number of directly involved citizens with special emphasis on youth is 1.750; the indirectly involved persons are around 5.200. The project will generate 45 appearances in local media. The project duration is 12 months.\n\n\n",
