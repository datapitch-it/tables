The `euroaccess.py` script ran successfully. The added debug logs showed a clear progression through fetching pages and extracting details for each call. The script successfully retrieved 161 items and saved them to `../data/euro-access.json`.

There were no indications of the script getting stuck or encountering any blocking issues during its execution. It's possible the initial perception of it being "stuck" was due to the time it takes to process all pages and individual call details, or a transient network issue that has since cleared.

The script completed its task as expected.
