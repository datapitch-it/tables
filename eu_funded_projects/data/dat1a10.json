A Study of the effect of steel scale in STEELAR technology was carried out, which made it possible to determine that thicker and more uneven scale layers tended to scatter and absorb ultrasonic waves more, leading to reduced signal clarity. This necessitated adjustments in sensor calibration and signal processing algorithms to mitigate the effects of scale. \\nIn addition, the development of the system software was completed with the development of a new tool that provides the user with a complete set of functions for loading, visualizing, analyzing and processing GW signal data, covering a range of signal processing techniques and analysis measurements.\\n\\nWP3 STEELAR mechanical hardware development: During this work package, the study of different materials for the encapsulation has been carried out, as well as different tests of its behavior and the working conditions that the system may encounter in industrial environments. Preliminary designs of the positioner manual have also been made. However, it is required to extend the time planning of this WP with the aim of reaching the expected milestones for this WP during RP1.\\n\\nLikewise, during RP2, the positioner scheme for off-line manual inspections has been designed and developed and, additionally, an off-line demonstrator at a laboratory scale has been designed and developed to validate and verify (in real laboratory test tasks) the performance of the possible off-line integration of the system in industrial factories.\\n\\nWP4 STEELAR laboratory testing: In this task, initiated and completed during PR2, the technical team involved in the project successfully carried out the integration of the STEELAR hardware with the software.\\nThus, laboratory tests and comparative studies with other residual stress inspection techniques were intensified, allowing the system to be validated and verified in a controlled environment.\\n\\nWP5 STEELAR system validation for lamination rolls during manufacturing at Valji’s facilities: TDuring this WP5, and based on the tests carried out, the market studies with other technologies and the research carried out on the tests, the STEELAR system was validated.\\n\\nThe investigation into stress monitoring in steel structures using Steelar EMAT system nonlinear ultrasonics has yielded significant insights into the stress distributions within steel rolls at various stages of processing. The testing demonstrates the effectiveness of EMAT nonlinear ultrasonics in monitoring and analyzing residual stresses in steel structures. The comprehensive data gathered from both pointwise and continuous measurements provide a clear picture of how stress distributions evolve during various processing stages. This methodology not only enhances our understanding of material behaviour under stress but also informs better manufacturing practices to ensure the structural integrity and longevity of steel products. By leveraging these insights, manufacturers can optimize processing techniques to mitigate stress-induced vulnerabilities, ultimately leading to higher quality and more reliable steel products.\\n\\n\\nWP6 STEELAR system validation during long products manufacturing at Sidenor’s facilities: As it happened in WP5, during this WP6, the STEELAR system was validated.\\n\\nOverall, the implementation of nonlinear ultrasonics for stress monitoring at Sidenor has led to significant improvements in the reliability and efficiency of structural integrity assessments. The comprehensive insights gained from this study will contribute to the advancement of industry standards and practices, reinforcing commitment to safety, quality, and innovation. By paving the way for future developments in non-destructive testing (NDT) and stress monitoring techniques, this study underscores the importance of continual technological advancement in maintaining and enhancing infrastructure safety.\\n\\nThe results of the industrial measurements show a good agreement regarding the levels of residual stresses expected in the materials analysed. Although this new technique allows characterizing the stress state of the material, the results are not directly comparable with those obtained with other methods. Among other causes, the depth at which stresses are measured can reach 1 mm, so the average value obtained may be substantially lower than other types of techniques in which the micron order is deepened. On the other hand, obtaining the stress in MPa requires having correct values of the elastoacoustic constant and performing calibrations with materials similar to those to be examined.\\n\\nWP7 Project management, IPR and Dissemination: During the reporting period, the coordination and monitoring of the project has been successfully carried out thanks to several activities that have taken place:\\n•\\tTechnical, administration and financial coordination of project activities\\n•\\tCollation of deliverables and progress reports\\n•\\tIntellectual property exploration\\n•\\tCommunication of project’s outcome\",\"finalResults\":\"There are several techniques available to measure the residual stress during steel manufacturing.

thus being able to adjust parameters in order to prevent or compensate it. \\n+Minimize production downtime and maintenance costs, trough remaining life forecasts and scheduled predictive maintenance. \\n+Increase operational health and safety, through a rigorous monitoring of stress levels in the roll, being able to forecast accidents, and removing the presence of operators in the vicinity by turning manual checks into automated inspections. \\n+Enhance steel manufacturers reputation across Europe.\\n+Save more than 100k€/year through a reduction in unexpected roll failure during their service life, avoiding material damages and non-availability costs associated with a line shutdown.\\n+Efficient use of resources and reduction in CO2 emissions thanks to a controlled production process, that reduces scrap rate (less wasted material) and reworks (less wasted energy), clearly aligned with Europe’s Green Deal and the energy and resource efficiency guidelines.\",\"periodFrom\":\"2023-01-01\",\"periodTo\":\"2024-06-30\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":null,\"currentFlag\":\"1\",\"periodNumber\":2}]"],"publications":["[]"]},"enrichedMetadata":{},"children":[],"highlightedFragments":[]},{"apiVersion":"2.138","reference":"43353764101085509","url":"uri -> https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43353764/101085509/ERASMUS2027","title":null,"contentType":"text/plain","language":"el","databaseLabel":"SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD","database":"SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD","summary":"Migration and EU: challenges and prospects","weight":1.0,"groupById":null,"content":"Migration and EU: challenges and prospects","accessRestriction":false,"pages":null,"checksum":"37833512878145829C0EE0F9C108F228313978288223765658A05278786F6E1F","metadata":{"subTypeOfAction":[],"typeOfAction":["ERASMUS Lump Sum Grants"],"es_SortDate":["2024-11-13T18:01:43.884+0100"],"endDate":["2025-09-30T00:00:00.000+0100"],"projectWebsite":[],"language":["el"],"title":["Migration and EU: challenges and prospects"],"deliverables":["[{\"id\":\"101085509_1_DELIVERASMUS2027\",\"title\":\"Quality Assurance and Evaluation Plan\",\"description\":\"Quality Assurance Plan will include: \\n- the necessary ESG Guidelines\\n-the QA objectives of the project\\n- the QA and Evaluation qualitative and quantitative indicators\\n- the Evaluation forms and questionnaires,Format: pdf file, Language: English\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project management and coordination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2023-02-28\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2023-11-30 17:21:34\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5f76dfa61/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101085509_2_DELIVERASMUS2027\",\"title\":\"Visual identity\",\"description\":\"Development of the public image and visual identity of the project, establishment of the projects website and social media page\",\"code\":\"Websites, patent fillings, videos etc\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Project management and coordination\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2023-03-15\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2023-11-30 17:21:34\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5f91d3fb8/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101085509_4_DELIVERASMUS2027\",\"title\":\"Course Program\",\"description\":\"The Course program will include all the necessary information for the students about the educational means, the timetable and the requirements for following up the module. ,Format: pdf file, Language: English\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"The Jean Monnet Course “MigratEUr”\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2023-03-07\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2023-11-30 17:21:34\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e5f8bd111c/Attachment_0.pdf\"},{\"id\":\"101085509_6_DELIVERASMUS2027\",\"title\":\"Call of papers\",\"description\":\"The Call of papers for the workshop will be a document inviting researchers to submit their abstract of their paper until a set date in order to present it to the workshop.Format: pdf file, Language: English\",\"code\":\"Document, report\",\"documentId\":null,\"workPackageTitle\":\"Workshop and Collective Volume “EU and Migration: Ten years after the 2015 crisis” and open discussion\",\"acceptedDate\":\"2024-11-05\",\"sourceUpdateDate\":\"2024-11-12 17:20:34\",\"deliverableLink\":\"/ec/local/weblogic/app/nas/sediahome/home/sedia/grants/docs/080166e512ad733f/Attachment_0.pdf\"}]"],"esST_checksum":["37833512878145829C0EE0F9C108F228313978288223765658A05278786F6E1F"],"objective":["Currently, there is no academic curriculum in Greece and internationally with a comprehensive course on migration policy and EU. Instead, there are sporadic efforts to single out specific parts of the policy. The Jean Monnet Module “Migration and the EU: challenges and prospects” ( MigratEUr) intends to fill this gap by offering a new interdisciplinary course on EU migration at the University of Piraeus, Greece. The module will apply an all-inclusive and interdisciplinary approach and include most of the different angles and dimensions of this complex policy area. The “ MigratEUr” module aims at implementing an academic course of EU studies using blended methodology, incorporating in-situ and on-line seminars as well as workshops. The course will encompass the various aspects of migration, from a political, legal and practical prism. The international expert team that is committed in teaching consists of experienced professionals of academics and practitioners but also young researchers, developing their academic career. In these means, the module’s main objective is to foster the multiplicity of EU studies by focusing on the examination of a subject that may be convoluted but form an outstanding example of EU politics and decision-making. The working language of the module will be English while it will be open to both undergraduate and postgraduate students apart from three universities, namely the University of Piraeus in Greece, the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel and the Ca’ Foscari University in Italy. Thus, it will offer to the participants a novel way to understand both the EU and migration. Furthermore, the MigratEUr project intends to implement training workshops for practitioners in the field of migration, social workers, teachers and other stakeholders aiming at disseminating the fundamentals of migration policy to professionals who need them in their everyday life.  The module also plans to spark the academic discussion of the progress made"],"esST_FileName":["file.txt"],"freeKeywords":["EU Migration Policy"," Security"," Human Rights"," External Cooperation"," Asylum Policy"],"DATASOURCE":["SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD"],"REFERENCE":["43353764101085509"],"subProgramme":[],"topicAbbreviation":["ERASMUS-JMO-2022-MODULE"],"overallBudget":["23000"],"topicDescription":[],"participants":["[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":999586941,\"legalName\":\"UNIVERSITY OF PIRAEUS RESEARCH CENTER\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"185 33\",\"street\":\"AL.

It includes mental health problems and mental illness. The data show that half of mental health issues have an onset by the age of 14 and 75% by age 24. The period of adolescence brings biological changes, psychological challenges and social pressures that combined with additional risk factors makes adolescents one of the most vulnerable groups to mental health issues.\n\nAs a contribution to solving the problem above, the main objective of this project is to develop an online evidence-based resource for adolescents’ significant others (e.g., physical education teachers, youth workers, coaches and parents) on the usage of physical activity and sport for the promotion of positive mental health and mitigation of mental illness. \n\nThis project will align with the salutogenic approach by investigating how physical activity may promote mental health and well-being of adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age. Although the developed materials will serve for the education of their significant others, the project will implement the participatory approach where the materials will be developed and informed by the adolescents themselves. The proposed project will:\n\n1) contribute to the understanding of physical activity and sport practices that facilitate positive and prevent negative mental health outcomes in adolescents;\n2) define the principles of good practice and provide examples;\n3) provide guidance on how to include adolescents’ perspectives on contexts and provision of sport and physical activities to support mental health that facilitate their participation;\n4) develop evidence-based resources for adolescents’ significant others to support usage of sport and physical activity in the context of mental well-being and their knowledge around the topic."],"esST_FileName":["file.txt"],"freeKeywords":["Mental-health"," sport and physical activity"," youth"," inclusion"," knowledge hub"],"DATASOURCE":["SEDIA_NONH2020_PROD"],"REFERENCE":["43353764101090537"],"subProgramme":[],"topicAbbreviation":["ERASMUS-SPORT-2022-SCP"],"overallBudget":["400000"],"topicDescription":[],"participants":["[{\"role\":\"coordinator\",\"pic\":946274771,\"legalName\":\"EUROPEAN NON-GOVERNMENTAL SPORTS ORGANISATION\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"100 61\",\"street\":\"BOX 11016\",\"city\":\"Stockholm\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"SE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Sweden\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"59.3371406\",\"longitude\":\"18.0472404\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"132736\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":1,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":932755978,\"legalName\":\"PARASPORTSKI SAVEZ GRADA RIJEKE\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"51000\",\"street\":\"SETALISTE IVANA GORANA KOVACICA 14\",\"city\":\"RIJEKA\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"HR\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Croatia\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"45.3657872\",\"longitude\":\"14.4050846\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"26175\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":2,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":999977463,\"legalName\":\"TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"80333\",\"street\":\"Arcisstrasse  21\",\"city\":\"Muenchen\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"DE\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Germany\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"48.1492598\",\"longitude\":\"11.568096\",\"activityType\":\"HSE\",\"eucontribution\":\"42687\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":3,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"HES\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":902757855,\"legalName\":\"SPORT ALGES E DAFUNDO\",\"postalAddress\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":null,\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":null,\"postalCode\":\"1495 035\",\"street\":\"AVENIDA DOS COMBATENTES DA GRANDE GUERRA 88\",\"city\":\"Alges\",\"countryCode\":{\"id\":0,\"abbreviation\":\"PT\",\"classId\":null,\"context\":null,\"description\":\"Portugal\",\"postalCode\":null,\"street\":null,\"city\":null,\"countryCode\":null}},\"latitude\":\"38.7027915\",\"longitude\":\"-9.2287735\",\"activityType\":\"Other\",\"eucontribution\":\"31770\",\"status\":\"Active\",\"order\":4,\"organizationType\":null,\"type\":\"OTH\",\"sme\":false},{\"role\":\"participant\",\"pic\":949702654,\"legalName\":\"INTERNATIONAL SPORT AND CULTURE ASSOCIATION -

action is promoting Union's regional quality wines (wines with PDO/PGI) from indigenous varieties (Xinomavro and Mavrud) in three third countries markets with high growth potential: China, Brazil and Belarus. Union wines are facing strong competition from third countries and pressures of its market shares. The main objective is to enhance the competitiveness of the wine sector in the two wine production areas (Imathia and Plovdiv) where wine plays an important role in the regional economy. This will be achieved by raising their profile as Quality wines recognized, denominated and appreciated within the Union; this will result in increase of demand and therefore increase of national exports to the three markets, for the benefit of Union market share. The action has identified trade channels (importers, distributors and retailers), multipliers and end users (consumers) as its key target groups and it provisions tailored activities for each of them. Through internet and social media the presence and advertising will promote key messages to all target groups; through stands at trade fairs, wine seminars and study trips to Europe, it will raise the profile of the products and train trade channels and multipliers on the products; through publications and tasting days it will approach larger segments of end consumers allowing for their familiarization with the intrinsic characteristics of the wines and increasing awareness on Union's Quality schemes. The two partners have worked in a similar multi information and promotion programme in the past with success. The action will last for three years and total budget is 1,795,172

action is promoting Union's regional quality wines (wines with PDO/PGI) from indigenous varieties (PDO Xinomavro, PDO/PGI Mavrud, PDO Samos and PGI Terasele Dunarii) in three third countries markets with high growth potential; South Korea, Singapore and Vietnam. Union wines are facing strong competition from third countries and pressures of its market shares. The main objective is to enhance the competitiveness of the wine sector in the three wine production areaswhere wine plays an important role to the regional economy. This will be achieved by raising their profile as Quality wines recognized, denominated and appreciated within the Union; this will result to the increase of demand and therefore increase of national exports to the three markets in favor of Union market share. The action has identified trade channels (importers, distributors and retailers), multipliers and end users (consumers) as its key target groups and it provisions tailored activities for each of them. Through internet and social media the presence and advertising will promote key messages to all target groups; through stands at trade fairs, wine seminars and study trips to Europe, will raise the profile of the products and train trade channels and multipliers on the products; through publications and tasting days will approach larger segments of end consumers allowing their familiarization with the intrinsic characteristics of the wines and increase awareness on Union's Quality schemes. The four partners have worked in a similar multi information and promotion programme in the past with success. The action will last for three years and total budget is 2.996.440 euro."],"esST_FileName":["file.txt"],"freeKeywords":["quality wines","legend","PDO","PGI","Xinomavro","Mavrud","Samos","Terasele
