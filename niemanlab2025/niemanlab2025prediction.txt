"About the organization/authorrediction": "The Nieman Journalism Lab is an attempt to help journalism figure out its future in an Internet age. The Internet has brought forth an unprecedented flowering of news and information. But it has also destabilized the old business models that have supported quality journalism for decades. Good journalists across the country are losing their jobs or adjusting to a radically new news environment online. We want to highlight attempts at innovation and figure out what makes them succeed or fail. We want to find good ideas for others to steal. We want to help reporters and editors adjust to their online labors; we want to help traditional news organizations find a way to survive; we want to help the new crop of startups that will complement — or supplant — them. We are fundamentally optimistic. We don’t pretend to have even five percent of all the answers, but we do know a lot of smart people. Primary among them are our readers; we hope your contributions will make the Lab a collaborative exchange of ideas. Tell us what’s happening around you, or what should be. We hope you enjoy the work we do, and that you’ll join the conversation as it evolves."

  "headline": "Lessons learned in The Building of Lost Causes",
  "summary": "“The skills we developed while facing down the fossil fuel industry — persistence through trolling campaigns, converting readers one by one, turning an upstart publication into essential reading — these aren’t just about journalism. They’re about how to keep building when everything around you feels like it’s crumbling.”",
  "prediction": "Ten years ago, in Vancouver’s oldest office building, a few colleagues and I launched what seemed like an impossible venture: a digital newspaper that would stand up to one of the most powerful forces on earth, the oil and gas industry. We funded it through crowdfunding and a handful of “social impact” investors who knew they might never see a return beyond social good. In one of North America’s least affordable cities, we found an affordable space in a building we came to call The Save the World Building — or, on darker days, The Building of Lost Causes. The names captured both our ambition and our doubt. We were attempting something unprecedented in resource-rich Canada: building the country’s first progressive national digital newspaper while providing critical coverage of an industry that seemed untouchable. The path ahead was uncharted, but we took the first step anyway. The stakes felt impossibly high as we investigated the oil sands’ health hazards, followed Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s prophetic flyover of the oil patch, and exposed a broken regulatory system. Our newsroom was unique in the building — we were journalists, not activists, though the offices around us were filled with environmental and social justice organizations. During fire drills, laughter would fill the stairwell, turning evacuation into impromptu celebration. When the alarms stopped, a different atmosphere would settle: the quiet of serious work, as we returned to our investigation of power, greed and environmental degradation. The day we launched our Kickstarter campaign, we took photos of ourselves — journalists laughing together while embarking on something untested. You can see by our smiles how much fun this all could be. What you don’t see is the grind, how often it felt like we were on a hike up a mountain where the peak is always moving away from you, always in the distance. For us, arrival meant sustainability. Sustainability meant predictability. Predictability meant recurring revenue. That meant convincing thousands of people to donate. Soon, I became exhausted from crowdfunding. The stress of those one-month campaigns was overwhelming. Hitting our goals brought elation — especially when we exceeded them. But soon enough, the cycle would begin again. We established a paywall, working elbow to elbow toward our holy grail: 10,000 paying subscribers written large on our whiteboard wall. Next door to our office, a woman lived illegally with her dozen cats, their smell wafting through our walls. We countered the stress of lawsuit threats with black humor as we exposed the government’s ties to international fossil fuel conglomerates. After our 2015 launch, the industry’s response was swift: coordinated trolling campaigns targeted our journalists on Twitter. We published story after story: federal spies monitoring citizens in church basements for protesting pipelines, Alberta’s government covering up health threats downstream from the oil sands. Bill McKibben had called Canada’s tar sands “the fuse of the carbon bomb.” In The Save the World Building, we watched it detonate. When the Liberal government took power, our focus shifted from the energy industry to climate change. Then I hit a wall. Through my office window, gentle rain fell on the park while I stared at devastating numbers. Outside my door, two talented reporters discussed their next story, unaware that we were heading off a cliff. At the same time, my mother-in-law was dying. That afternoon, my husband and I drove through the Okanagan to join the family vigil at his mother’s bedside. For seven days, I tried to push the spreadsheets from my mind, but the numbers followed me there. After her death, I collapsed. At home, buried under covers, I sobbed — certain that the  National Observer  was dying too. For the first time in our journey from hyper-local to national publication, I had no fight left. I reached out to advisory board members about bankruptcy, a word that had always terrified me. A wonderful man on the board named Andy Wright who had built and sold a technology company told me to get out of bed. “Every founder comes to this moment when they feel all is lost,” he said. “It’s just a stage. So, here’s what you need to do. Get out of bed. Roll up your sleeves. Let’s get to work. I’m going to be with you every day until you get through this.” He helped me round up enough new investment to get us through until a few new contracts would close, the most significant of which was a subscription deal with the Government of Canada. I tell this story now because the Save the World Building seems like a good metaphor for what we are facing as we come to the end of 2024. In 2016, we faced what seemed impossible: building independent journalism when fossil fuel interests dominated every institution, our government was spying on citizens in church basements, and traditional media was failing. We learned to create stability while working from a building that could collapse in an earthquake at any moment — a building full of people working on causes that had the potential to bring about real and positive changes, but that could also feel impossible to achieve. Now, as we enter 2024 with the foundations of democracy feeling as shaky as that old structure, I return to those lessons. Not as a formula — there are no easy answers — but as evidence that even in a building of big dreams and lost causes, small groups of determined people can build something that lasts. The skills we developed while facing down the fossil fuel industry — persistence through trolling campaigns, converting readers one by one, turning an upstart publication into essential reading — these aren’t just about journalism. They’re about how to keep building when everything around you feels like it’s crumbling. Last week in New York, I heard journalists describe their paralysis about democracy’s future in words I remember all too well: resigned, depressed, helpless, overwhelmed. “I know there’s nothing I can really do about it,” they said — the same words that caused me to lose faith in myself as I’d trudge up the sharp spiral staircase in Vancouver’s oldest office building. I’ve learned so much since then. When I hear people talk about giving up now, I remember my own paralysis back then. But I also remember what happened next: when the numbers looked impossible, when trolls flooded our mentions, when the future looked bleak — you get granular. You bear down on your beat. You focus on the next investigation. You find the next subscriber, the next funder, the next nation-rocking revelation. You build your foundation story by story, even when the ground beneath you could shift at any moment. You roll up your sleeves. None of this would have been possible without the vision of more than 20 Canadian foundations who recognized that journalism plays a critical role in the climate crisis. Working through our fiscal partner, the Institute for Education, Sustainability and Action, we’ve developed contractual relationships that maintain our full editorial independence while ensuring sustainable funding. Together with our subscribers and individual donors, they’ve helped us build a diverse revenue model: 40% from contracts, 40% from reader revenue, and 20% from government grants and subsidies. These collaborations have proved that when the stakes are high enough, traditional funding models can evolve to meet the moment. More importantly, they showed that rigorous journalism can maintain its independence while collaborating with mission-aligned organizations who understand that investigating environmental threats and documenting climate solutions isn’t just journalism — it’s essential infrastructure for an informed democracy. I’ve seen what it takes to build something that survives in this industry — from our laughing Kickstarter photos to the moment I collapsed under my covers certain National Observer was dying. And now, having built a newsroom that forced governments to confront oil sands health hazards and exposed federal spies in church basements, here’s what I predict: The newsrooms that make it through 2024 won’t be the ones with the cleanest business plans or the most polished pitches. They’ll be the ones who’ve learned to live in contradiction — to keep pursuing devastating stories while wrestling with devastating numbers. They’ll master what we learned in that old Vancouver building: how to simultaneously track international fossil fuel conglomerates and track down the next subscriber. How to expose government coverups and highlight climate solutions while securing government contracts. How to build something lasting while the ground shifts beneath you. It’s not noble work. It’s necessary work. And it’s the only way independent journalism survives — by being as relentless about funding as we are about finding the stories power wants to bury. I know this because we did it. What seemed impossible in that Building of Lost Causes became inevitable, not because we were special, but because we refused to give up.

  "headline": "Publishers find the AI era not all that lucrative",
  "summary": "“Welcome, surely. Lucrative, in a sense. Game changer? Hardly.”",
  "prediction": "“The AI era,”  Sara Fischer writes in Axios , “is proving lucrative for media publishers looking to offset a slowdown in ads and subscription fatigue.” My prediction for 2025 is that this will not be true for most news organizations, because they’ll find that no technology companies are interested in paying for their content. While in one sense unwelcome, recognizing this upfront might help focus editorial thinking on what really does matter — offering something people are willing to pay attention to and perhaps even pay for. Yes, we’ve seen a spate of deals between various publishers and technology companies developing artificial intelligence, including deals for training data, inference, and more. But we are talking dozens of deals in a world with many thousands of news publishers. And looking at  who these deals involve , the bulk of them are large English-language publishers, often upmarket ones. Most news organizations, however, are not large or upmarket. And globally, of course, most are not English-language. Even for those few who have deals, a lot hinges on what one means by “lucrative.” There is often zero transparency about the nature and value of deals that publishers and technology companies strike. And when headline financial figures are announced (no doubt with strategic intent), it’s often unclear what mix of cash payment, projected revenue share, and credits is involved. But we can examine one rare concrete case where there is some certainty about the cash value — the U.S. publishing conglomerate Dotdash Meredith. According to public financial documents from its parent company IAC and first reported  by Adweek , OpenAI is paying around $16 million per year to license content. That is no doubt welcome incremental revenue, and you could call it “lucrative” in the sense of having a fat margin, as OpenAI is almost certainly paying for content that was already being produced. But to put things into perspective, Dotdash Meredith is on course to generate over $1.5 billion in revenues in 2024, more than a third of it from print. So the OpenAI deal is equal to about 1% of the publisher’s total revenue. If that strikes you as low, remember that OpenAI’s deal with Axel Springer,  said to be worth about $10 million per year , is worth well under 1% of  Springer’s media revenues . Welcome, surely. Lucrative, in a sense. Game changer? Hardly. Continued decline in print revenues alone will have a far bigger impact on both Dotdash Meredith and Axel Springer’s revenues in 2025 than their deals with OpenAI. And this is for two of the so far very few publishers who have actually gotten deals! About a year ago, the  Reuters Institute  surveyed news and media leaders across the world on their expectations when it came to negotiations with AI companies on licensing. 35% of respondents expected most of the money to go to big media companies, and a further 48% said there would be very little money for any news company. So far, you could say that both groups have been right. Most of the deals have gone to big media companies, and they have, in the grander scheme of things, involved relatively little money. Given that various lawsuits and lobbying efforts will likely drag on, the main factor that could lead to a different outcome would be a dramatic political intervention. The question then is whether publishers can expect this — or should even seek it — from the very politicians they also say they hold to account. (Would, say, the U.S. news media want to rely on favors from the incoming Trump administration?) So my prediction for 2025 is that most publishers will not get any meaningful revenue from licensing content to technology companies, and that those who do are likely to be large publishers who get at most a few percent of incremental revenue. For most publishers, while perhaps a disappointing prospect, I hope this will also be liberating. If they don’t stand around waiting for the Godot of elusive AI licensing deals, they can focus on what matters — creating value not for tech companies’ training models, but for members of the public who want to make sense of the world beyond personal experience.

  "headline": "Embrace the barbell",
  "summary": "“It’s time to abandon middling stories and go very short or very long.”",
  "prediction": "We live in a time of  media fragmentation  and  hyperpolarization . This year’s presidential election raised further questions about  traditional media’s relevance . And it seems increasingly clear that people are gravitating to extremes in the types of content they consume — whether  scrolling short-form posts  or  listening to hours-long podcasts . We must meet them there. When news organizations try to do everything, they think they’re showing strength, but they’re inadvertently contributing to their own vulnerability. The result is a flood of mediocre content that becomes easier to dismiss, easier to replace with less-credible sources, easier to lose in the noise. It’s time to abandon middling stories and go very short or very long. The traditional story format faces pressure from multiple directions: social media and multi-format approaches (Vine walked so TikTok could run) and now, AI’s efficient and information-dense delivery. Text-based storytelling that is neither immediate nor deep or compelling enough to serve readers’ needs is becoming structurally obsolete, as noted by commenters like  Rafat Ali . In finance, the “ barbell strategy ” balances reward and risk by focusing on the extremes while avoiding middle-of-the-road choices. Media needs its own “barbell strategy.” Focusing on the extremes can be uncomfortable. After all, most of life takes place in the gray zones. But extremes can provide clarity. At one end is immediate information — efficiently and quickly helping people understand why something matters, delivered through  the ambient formats  people actually use, from memes to vertical video. It’s why Pop Base and Pop Crave are now  breaking news providers . At the other end is deep, authoritative reporting that uncovers new information and reveals patterns or challenges conventional wisdom, building the shared understanding necessary for democracy to function and society to thrive. Think of the agenda-setting #MeToo coverage. This end can also include definitive explainers on  complex foreign policy issues  and  thoughtful serialized newsletters . By focusing resources on excellence at both ends of the barbell, news organizations can rebuild trust through consistent delivery of clear value: either immediate understanding or lasting insight. This strategy isn’t just about better serving audiences — it’s also about journalism’s survival. The stakes are high. News organizations, like all democratic institutions,  can fall unless defended . And for journalism to defend itself, we must first fight to maintain our relevance. In the words of  András Pethő  of the investigative reporting nonprofit  Direkt36  in Hungary, where news media has been effectively dismantled: “If there has been one lesson during this journey, it is that nothing really matters other than the audience…Our only source of power is our audience. The bigger and more diverse it is, the bigger our defense against any autocrat who wants to crush us.” Millie Tran  is chief digital content officer at the Council on Foreign Relations. "

  "summary": "“If all of this sounds like a libertarian fever dream, I hear you. But as these markets rise, legacy media will continue to slide into irrelevance.”",
  "prediction": "For decades, the news industry has operated on a familiar rhythm: Journalists chase scoops, publish headlines, and define the news cycle. But a new model for information sharing is emerging. Prediction markets — platforms where users buy and sell shares based on the probability of future events — are poised to disrupt the media landscape in 2025, transforming not only how news is shared but how it is valued and consumed. You may have heard about prediction markets during the recent U.S. presidential election. The prediction market Polymarket got a lot of press by accurately predicting the electoral outcome hours before the media called it. Joe Rogan said that at Mar-a-Lago on election night, Elon Musk had a “magical app” that told him the election results in advance. That app was not magic — it was Polymarket. Polymarket is one of many prediction markets whose usage has exploded in the past year. Others include Kalshi, PredictIt, Manifold Markets, and Metaculus. While Polymarket remains technically illegal for U.S. residents, Kalshi operates a prediction market legally in the U.S. per an October  appeals court decision . Prediction markets are currently in legal limbo, but I’d bet against a ban, especially given the new administration. Why are prediction markets relevant to the future of news? In this most recent presidential election, prediction markets tended to show Trump at a 60% chance of victory ahead of the election, whereas legacy models like those of Nate Silver showed Trump at a 50% chance of victory. It’s incredibly hard to know how any news event might unfold, but prediction markets are creating new structures to surface information in real time. Prediction markets create incentives for people with information to share what they know. This is what happened with  the French whale  who bet huge sums on Polymarket that Trump would win, because he had access to proprietary polling that suggested that more people than reported would vote for Trump. Anyone who thinks they can have an edge on the outcome of a news event, or predict news events before they happen, can put their money where their belief is. At their core, prediction markets are a form of decentralized information gathering. They theoretically reward accuracy over sensationalism, prioritizing actionable data instead of attention-grabbing headlines. They also bring to light news events that might have otherwise gone unnoticed by traditional newsrooms. Instead of journalists manufacturing narratives rife with editorial bias, market incentives surface compelling information. This more decentralized information ecosystem poses a direct challenge to the pundit class — the columnists, talking heads, and forecasters who dominate traditional news cycles. When thousands of users collectively predict the outcome of an event, the aggregated result often surpasses the accuracy of any single expert. The rise of prediction markets raises questions about ethics and regulation. Current platforms are primed for market manipulation, insider trading, and the potential for bad actors to game the system. Platforms will need to enforce rigorous safeguards to maintain credibility and prevent misinformation from being incentivized. Journalists will also face ethical dilemmas as prediction markets are normalized. Should reporters participate in markets they cover? How do outlets navigate the blurred line between reporting on probabilities and influencing them? Ultimately, the widespread adoption of prediction markets is really just a continuation of the broader shift toward decentralization and user-driven information sharing. Much like how social media empowered content creators to leverage the internet to become the media, prediction markets allow users to quantify and monetize the information they have access to. If all of this sounds like a libertarian fever dream, I hear you. But as these markets rise, legacy media will continue to slide into irrelevance, and we might soon discover a whole new class of people who can break news and share information about our world.

  "summary": "“Once the goal is no longer to recreate news organizations as they existed in the past, but rather to ensure that reliable news and information flows — that there is a place in people’s lives for deliberation and debate — then possibility blossoms.”",
  "prediction": "Predictions — said someone — are a fool’s game. But there’s little doubt that in the next year we will continue to bear painful witness to the decline of America’s formal news structures. Twentieth-century news outlets will keep crashing by the wayside — victims to changing business and technological models, to hubris, to cultural mistrust and to overall irrelevance in people’s daily lives. But it’s also true that news and information won’t stop circulating and that people won’t stop talking to their neighbors about thorny topics. People without free presses, or laws to protect journalists, have always found ways to collect and share news, to debate and compromise on the issues of the day. In a non-democratic country like Cuba, people have long passed flash drives hand to hand, containing stories unlikely to make it past the scrutiny of censors. In his book  The Literary Underground of the Old Regime , Robert Darnton outlines all the ways French publishers in the 17th century managed to get their work out despite royal threats. Go into any neighborhood today in America, especially ones that have never been served by mainstream news organizations, and you’ll find people fulfilling the roles required by a free press — listener, reporter, synthesizer, convener, publisher, sense maker, and so on. You’ll find people who are trusted by their neighbors, acting as news collectors and sharers, as facilitators of difficult conversations and painful compromise. I have long been interested in the idea of informal news networks, and what role these often unseen systems of communication might play in the future, as America slides further away from its democratic aspirations. In research I’ve conducted on the topic, I’ve learned about a barber in Baltimore who hosts casual discussion groups while cutting hair; a UPS driver in Central California who delivers sensitive information along with his packages; a woman in Detroit who documents neighborhood evictions in a self-published newsletter; the community college professors in Shasta, California who started a podcast during the Carr wildfires; and an elderly woman in Orange County who reads the news on a YouTube channel in her native Vietnamese dialect. I recently moved to a small rural town, and within two weeks I had identified our local “reporter”: a woman who knew everything and everyone, who could answer any question about local politics, local events, or local history, and had an uncanny ability to make everyone with whom she interacted trust her. I do not feel foolish, therefore, to predict that informal news networks like these are going to play increasingly important roles in the near future. The question for professional journalists and other champions of the news business is this: Will we look down on these networks, ignore them, or join them? It’s to all of our benefit to chose the latter path. Working together — professional newsrooms with individual community members, with local civic institutions, with parents groups, with faith-based organizations, with arts groups, and so on — we can strengthen and build local news systems that are resilient rather than brittle. News “products” can be face-to-face conversation, text chains, WhatsApp groups, wheat-pasted fliers, art exhibits, local discussions about international pieces of investigative journalism, Facebook groups, and YouTube channels — as well as written articles, podcasts, and video. At  Journalism + Design , we’ve chosen to partner with community colleges in this work. We co-design approaches to identifying and nurturing informal news networks, sometimes providing certificate programs in community journalism, sometimes partnering with local media outlets — such as Signal Cleveland, El Tímpano, and Fresnoland — and sometimes hosting photography exhibits at our physical space in Oakland, California. But that’s just how we’ve chosen to work. Once the goal is no longer to recreate news organizations as they existed in the past, but rather to ensure that reliable news and information flows — that there is a place in people’s lives for deliberation and debate — then possibility blossoms. The recent presidential election has sent shockwaves through communities of people who care about a free press. It’s worth remembering for all the distraction of the president-elect himself, that this victory is the culmination of a hundred years of activism. Books like  Invisible Hands: The Businessman’s Crusade  by NYU professor Kim Phillips-Fien,  Dark Money  by The New Yorker writer Jane Mayer, and  Democracy in Chains  by historian Nancy MacLean tell the origin stories of today’s far-right libertarian movement — stretching back to the mid-1930s, when men like  Irénée DuPont , president of the DuPont company, organized tirelessly against the New Deal, to the billions poured into libertarian causes by Charles Koch starting in the 1960s. All of those people were planting seeds that have been slowly coming to fruition decades and decades later. Today, as we face what can feel like unsurmountable challenges, when we see a society failing in many of the ways most vital that it succeed, it can be easy to be demoralized. But this is just the moment when we need to be most diligent planting the seeds for the future we want — even if we won’t be there to see them bear fruit. I predict that there are enough of us willing to step forward into the uncertainty and nurture the seeds of what could be. Heather Chaplin  is director of  Journalism + Design  at The New School. "

  "prediction": "We’ve covered 2024 as the fragmentation election, and media analysts mostly assume fragmentation will continue — more and more podcasts and Substacks and hyper-personalized TikTok accounts, and a weaker and weaker big media.  But as one of the great early internet CEOs  once said , there are only two ways to go in media: bundling and unbundling. Just when you think one of those trends is in control, the pendulum starts swinging back. And there are big reasons both on the consumer and the corporate side to expect a wave of bundling. The consumer push is obvious: The number of subscriptions you need to stay informed across entertainment and news is insane, unmanageable, and expensive. Consumers are overwhelmed by information and disoriented by complicated choices. At Semafor, part of our secret has been helping our readers navigate this chaotic, untrustworthy patchwork of paid and free content. I love many Substacks, read some of them, but can’t continue paying $200 a month combined. I’d expect an annual Substack subscription to hit in 2025 as individual publishers struggle to survive the coming wave of churning unsubscriptions. Meanwhile, I want to watch shows on Max, Netflix, Prime, Hulu, and Apple TV+ — but it’s enraging to pay for all those subscriptions on top of YouTube TV for sports. Consumers are hitting a breaking point, and streamers are starting to respond with new bundles — but if they don’t move fast enough, they’ll find other players happy to bundle. Verizon, amazingly, offers a  Netflix/Max package . If media companies can’t figure out how to be the bundlers, other layers of the ecosystem — telecoms, devices, social platforms — will.  Big corporations, meanwhile, are also driving toward consolidation. The Trump administration is more likely than Biden to wave through big media mergers — including another endlessly considered WarnerMedia sale. Elon Musk is building a new conservative/populist creator platform for the right on X. His only rival, Fox Corp. — cash rich, but desperate for a younger audience — will sweep up a generation of digital media led by The Daily Wire that needs its distribution to compete with X.

  "summary": "“When journalists take the time to explain these layers, it signals respect for the intelligence and curiosity of their audience.”",
  "prediction": "If I’m going to predict the future, I find it useful to return to the past. As a kid, I wanted to be a journalist because I dreamed of seeing the world, meeting people who were different from me, and telling their stories. I suspect many of us were drawn to journalism for similar reasons: curiosity, connection, and the desire to bring untold stories to light. Somewhere along the way, the industry lost that focus, replacing it with talking heads, soundbites and clickbait. Audiences saw through this. They lost trust. We can talk about AI and subscription pricing models till the next election cycle, but none of that matters if we’ve lost sight of our why. In 2025, journalism has an opportunity to return to its roots by embracing what I’ll argue is a loud and clear consumer demand for long and deep authenticity. Audiences crave deep, meaningful conversations that represent the broad, nuanced spectrum of who we are, what we think, and what we believe. And the answer is the very thing that we let die at the hands of the trendy listicle: longform. Despite assumptions about shrinking attention spans, audiences are showing a clear preference for longform content. These trends are a testament to one thing: When the content is compelling and authentic, people are willing to invest their time. The success of longform content across platforms is a wake-up call for journalism. Here’s how this shift can shape the future of journalism: Trust in journalism has been eroding for years, and we’ve finally reached the tipping point. Journalism has become exclusive. Whether you’re in the machine or consuming the machine, you need to say the right thing and have the right ideas. Nobody feels like they are represented by traditional media. If an institution isn’t for you, how can you trust it? Longform storytelling offers a path to rebuild that trust. Longform gives participants the space to provide context and explore nuance. Audiences don’t just want the “what” of a story; they want to understand the “why” and “how.” When journalists take the time to explain these layers, it signals respect for the intelligence and curiosity of their audience. Moreover, longform formats allow for transparency. Podcasts feature unedited conversations where interviewers and guests can openly discuss biases, uncertainties, and the complexities of an issue. This kind of openness builds credibility because it mirrors how audiences process information in their own lives: through dialogue and exploration, not soundbites. Rebuilding trust is not just about producing better stories; it’s about reestablishing a relationship with the audience. Longform journalism creates that connection, offering readers, listeners, and viewers something more substantial — a sense that their time, attention, and intellect are valued. In 2025, this is the key to journalism’s survival. Journalism’s future lies in its past: the original mission to explore, connect, and tell stories that matter. By returning to storytelling and holding space for conversations that respects the audience’s intellect and curiosity, journalism can rebuild the trust it has lost and secure its role in shaping a connected world.

  "prediction": "This will be the year journalism finally explains arcane legislative rules to the public — for national, state, and local government. Most people find talk of clotures, filibusters, committee votes, bill reconciliation, the legislative calendar, and beyond absolutely boring. If civic-affairs news is the broccoli of American journalism, then coverage of legislative procedure is the unsalted lima bean. Journalists’ imperative to explain all this to the public isn’t just about giving America (and the world) a civics lesson — rather, it may well amount to the best defense we have for maintaining democratic norms and holding politicians accountable. And at a time when there is a trifecta of Republican leadership at the federal level — despite Donald Trump’s 1.6 percentage point win — the counterpoint to the Republican legislative agenda may well depend on how American politicians are able to manipulate what amounts to a hyped-up version of Robert’s Rules of Order. Perhaps you’ve only recently learned why recess appointments matter — but it’s this kind of politicking with procedural statutes that will be the stuff of controversy for the next administration. Many of us were raised on  the Schoolhouse Rock version of how a bill becomes a law  — it remains a classic explainer even today. But the reality is that the daily functioning of what happens in Congress depends on procedural statutes that are nuanced, confusing, and, quite frankly, boring — despite their relevance for the future of democratic life. Just how well legislators can manipulate these rules to their advantage can change the course of history — and sometimes, the force of tradition is just not compelling enough to politicians seeking to advance their agenda. For instance, despite prior historical precedent, Senator Mitch McConnell and 11 other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were  able to block proceedings  to move forward with Obama’s Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland. In a recent example, the House Ethics Committee  was able to block the public release  of a report about Rep. Matt Gaetz’s alleged sexual misconduct, drug use, and other unethical behavior. Legislators respected the decision; no such report has been made available. Journalists made enough noise,  perhaps , for Gaetz to stand aside as Trump’s pick for Attorney General. This matters at the state level, too. Just before Thanksgiving, Louisiana’s House judiciary committee voted against creating “specialized courts” for  “complex business cases,”  but Republican leaders somehow kept the bill alive. And unlike the Schoolhouse Rock version of American civics, many of the delay tactics and strategies for introducing bills into laws, voting on appointments, appropriating budgets, and so on aren’t delineated in the Constitution. Procedural statutes also impact how executive agencies implement policies. As per the Congressional Research Service, this  rule-making power  has the force of law. Journalists need to be proactive about covering politicians’ smart procedural shenanigans and cannot wait for a story to happen and respond. Manipulating procedure isn’t unconstitutional, because most of it is not in the Constitution, but it’s unclear what exactly compels any legislators to follow these procedural statutes, and the extent to which procedural processes are actually just norms rather than anything codified. The role journalists have to play in this form of government accountability couldn’t be more vital — but these types of stories have always been seen as inside baseball. Centering this coverage is going to require breaking old habits and ways of thinking about political coverage, but editors and producers need to change their perspectives, for the sake of our democracy. Given the contemporary makeup of Congress and the new administration, there’s no telling whether any of the procedural statutes and traditional norms that structure how government works will actually continue — and what happens if politicians choose to ignore or subvert them. Journalists, please, let this be the year you help the rest of us understand how and when to cry fowl, raise hell, or smirk quietly while “our” side notches a sneaky win on a legislative technicality.

  "prediction": "In 2025, more podcasts will move from audio and video to the stage — and not just the big ones with big budgets. This already-growing trend will be adapted and invigorated by mid-tier and smaller shows whose audiences have been steadily increasing for years, whose listeners yearn for live interactions with hosts and shows that have become integral to their lives. More importantly, these committed listeners will happily pay for these events, whether at a small local theater, an artsy venue, the neighborhood bar with open mics, or a college auditorium used for lectures during the day. Podcasting is great at building community. But there are severe limits to the depth of engagement and connection that can be achieved between a compelling show and its loyal audience when everything happens via RSS feed. That’s where live events come in, with engaging conversations, musical guests, games and trivia, and sponsors who want to put their products in the hands of the most loyal media consumer around. Here are three reasons audiences will embrace mid-level and smaller live podcast events (and how you can plan accordingly): The key to launching a live podcast event is to test the idea and scale it up. Start with a group of friends and family, get their honest feedback, stay on budget, and go from there. Just like your show grew incrementally, so will your live events. But you have to start.

  "prediction": "Do you ever visit a friend’s house and find yourself surprised at how different their Netflix queue looks than yours? Or worry about the breaking down of  a shared reality  amid an increasingly fractured media landscape? As more of our digital experiences become mediated by personalization algorithms and fandoms built around individual content creators, I believe there’s an opportunity in 2025 for information services that give people back a sense of context and overview. Data will play a key part. During the recent U.S. election, many people highlighted  the well-documented partisan gaps  in our perception of inflation and the economy. The antidote to  this perception gap  is actual data about the economy’s performance — provided it’s presented in a way that makes it interesting, easy to understand, and relevant to people’s interests. Data and context not only informs — it empowers us to make better decisions. These could be as big as economic policy, or as small as everyday decisions on what TV shows to watch, what to eat, or where to go on vacation. At Yahoo, we’re setting out to build exactly these types of data services: guides that draw on a variety of metrics to help you situate yourself, navigate different walled-garden media spaces, and discover things beyond what algorithms understand to be in your interest graph. These could include: We believe contextual data is complementary, not mutually exclusive, to personalized recommendations. Being able to see a ranking of the most-discussed TV shows alongside a list of shows most relevant to your interests only makes both lists more interesting.

  "prediction": "The hard question isn’t how journalists should cover Trump, but how they should relate to Trump voters. Now that the furor of the election has died down, perhaps political coverage might be perceived as a little less partisan. And perhaps there’s an opening for conservative audiences to return to the news, if they’re not worried about journalists shilling for Biden or Harris. Perhaps, but unlikely. Inviting conservative audiences back into the fold would require major changes to the way newsrooms operate, and I just don’t think we’ll see that in 2025. If you’re any sort of media watcher, you’re probably aware that most major newsrooms now serve mostly liberal audiences. Here are the self-identified politics of those who say they got political and election news from each source as of 2019, according to  Pew Research . Conservative readers of The Washington Post had  declined to “single digits” by 2018 , with over 80% of readers identifying as “liberal” or “very liberal.” This year we learned that NPR’s conservative audience had  declined to 11% . There are different ways to react to this. Do conservative audience losses mean that news publishers are biased? I don’t think that’s the right place to start. Instead, we should ask about the mission of the newsroom. Who, exactly, do journalists hope to serve? It’s okay if a newsroom decides it only exists to serve liberal audiences, just as it’s okay if it only serves conservatives. If the idea of media pluralism means anything, it means that. But there is also a long tradition of journalism as  a shared resource , a unifier, providing high quality information for all. It would be interesting and probably useful for newsroom leadership to take a stand: either recommit to the principle of serving all Americans regardless of their politics, or admit that it just isn’t interesting anymore to keep conservatives engaged. If your news organization is one of those who wants to serve all citizens, there are ways you can learn how.  Tangle  is a small but rapidly growing newsletter that has a truly  bipartisan format  — and an audience to match.  Trusting News  has extensive  advice and trainings  for newsrooms who want to connect with audiences of all types, including  specific advice for connecting with conservatives .  Ground News  is a paid news aggregator which  curates  stories that are not being reported by one side. But it grieves me to predict that even the newsrooms who say they want to serve all Americans won’t do any of this. At best, they’ll mostly continue to ignore the problem. At worst, some journalists will blame the audience. If you’ve been around the professional journalism scene over the last decade you know what I mean. You’ve heard the comments in bars in D.C., or dinner parties in New York, or the hallways of journalism conferences.  They  don’t actually value the truth.  They  are uneducated.  They  are racist. Anyway, why would we bother trying to inform people who hate us? There’s a grain of truth to all of these criticisms. There really is more misinformation on the conservative side — as  judged  by conservatives! (But then again, there is a dearth of quality conservative news outlets.) Republican voters really do tend to be less educated. (Meanwhile, Democrats have  become  the party of wealthy voters and donors.) And yes, conservatives score slightly  higher  on social scientists’ measures of racism. (But available data suggests racism  isn’t  what put Trump back in office.) And while there certainly are extremists out there, most conservatives aren’t. As Joy Mayer of Trusting News  put it : “It is reasonable for journalists to feel defeated by people with a deeply entrenched view that journalists are the enemy. But it is dangerous (and inaccurate) to assume that means distrust in the news is always connected to belief in extreme political views.” If you’re reading this, you probably have liberal politics. Nothing wrong with that. The problem is, pretty much everyone in journalism  also  has liberal politics. Journalists as a whole are significantly more liberal than average. By some estimates, most are more liberal than Democratic politicians like Barack Obama and even Bernie Sanders. Here’s  one estimate  of journalists’ political ideology based on their Twitter networks, which  previous research  showed accurately predicts partisan self-identification: This is an issue because we all tend to stereotype people who are politically different as more extreme than they actually are. This is called  the perception gap  and holds across many different political issues. To make matters worse, the most extreme politicians receive a  wildly disproportionate  share of coverage, further skewing our everyday perception of the other side. Journalists bear some responsibility for this, of course. These attitudes and misperceptions aren’t going to change without sustained cultural work within the newsroom. It would require trainings, editorial  guidance on language , a different approach to editorial  transparency , perhaps sensitivity readers — ironically, all of the apparatus of inclusiveness that newsrooms have already built. I am sure that what I am suggesting will be interpreted by some as arguing for false balance, or letting lies go unchallenged. That’s not what I’m saying at all. I’m saying the fundamental reason that newsrooms are having trouble keeping conservative audiences is that conservatives are  other . Newsrooms tend to stereotype them unintentionally, not pay enough attention to the stories that matter to them, and generally signal disinterest or even disrespect. That isn’t good journalism by anyone’s book. The hard question is not how journalists should cover Trump, but how they should relate to Trump voters. If there’s one bright spot in all of this, it’s that genuine empathy across differences is exactly the kind of thing that journalists are trained to do.

  "headline": "The media reckons with AGI",
  "summary": "“Rather than treat AGI as a fringe concern, we must be proactive and ambitious: taking the possibility seriously, considering the implications, and starting a public, democratic conversation.”",
  "prediction": "In 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen  told  the U.S. Senate that man-made climate change was real, imminent, and potentially catastrophic. It was a perfect opportunity for the media to start covering the issue with the importance and urgency it deserved. Yet journalists did not rise to the occasion. For decades, they  peddled  both-sidesism,  failing  to take seriously the scientific consensus and not adequately  discussing  how to tackle the problem. In recent years, newsrooms have begun to cover the climate crisis properly. But that delay has been costly: Journalism’s failure has  undoubtedly  led the public and policymakers to take the issue much less seriously than they should have. Had we been faster to heed Hansen’s warnings, perhaps we wouldn’t find ourselves in such a mess today. I fear we may be making the same mistake with artificial general intelligence (AGI) — AI that can achieve or surpass human-level performance across a wide range of cognitive tasks. Bring up AGI to most journalists and you’ll get an eyeroll and a scoff. The idea of imminent, human-level AI,  many   say , is just a marketing stunt dreamt up by tech executives. It’s a sci-fi fantasy — certainly not something to take seriously. But talk to the people actually working at AI companies and you get a different story. For them, AGI isn’t a marketing ploy — it is, as former OpenAI board member Helen Toner recently  told  the Senate, “an entirely serious goal.” These people are sincerely trying to build computers that can do everything humans can do. And they expect to succeed soon: Many  believe  we’ll achieve this in the next two years, and even long-time skeptics like Meta’s Yann LeCun now  think  we’ll have AGI within a decade or two. Independent scientists and researchers, such as Yoshua Bengio and Nobel winner Geoffrey Hinton, agree. They could be wrong; people have incorrectly thought AGI was imminent before. But given the astonishing rate of progress — and the fact that, as of this year, systems  already   surpass  humans at a variety of PhD-level tasks — we ought to seriously consider the possibility that they are right, and that transformative AI is coming soon. If so, the implications would be staggering. An AI system capable of doing everything a human can would allow for the automation of huge swathes of knowledge work. Thousands of human-level systems, working in parallel, could massively accelerate  scientific progress . Economic growth  could  boom. Warfare  could  permanently change. The ramifications for democracy and geopolitics would be profound. And that’s before we even consider the catastrophic risks that many experts  fear  transformative AI could pose. If such change is on the horizon, the public ought to be involved. But right now, almost everyone seriously engaging with the possibility of imminent AGI works at an AI company. In the absence of regulation, these companies are able to make unilateral decisions that will affect all of humanity. That is not acceptable. Journalism must step up. Rather than treat AGI as a fringe concern, we must be proactive and ambitious: taking the possibility seriously, considering the implications, and starting a public, democratic conversation. So what should newsrooms do? First, stop dismissively framing AGI discussions as marketing stunts. As Fortune’s Jeremy Kahn  notes , assuming such talk is purely cynical marketing “may do readers a disservice.” Just because something sounds outlandish doesn’t mean it isn’t worth serious consideration. Second, significantly expand AI coverage. At  Tarbell , we consistently see important stories going uncovered due to resource constraints. If AGI is genuinely on the horizon, this may be the most consequential story of our time. It deserves commensurate attention and investment. We provide support with our fellowship and grants programs for AI reporting, but we can’t do it alone. Finally, journalists ought to interrogate what a world with AGI could or should look like. We can examine how the police and military will use — or abuse — such technology. We can platform academic voices investigating AGI’s potential effects on inequality. And we can scrutinize whether governments are doing enough to avert the technology’s potentially catastrophic risks. The window for journalism to rise to this challenge is still open, but it’s closing fast. In 2025, we’ll either see newsrooms step up to help society grapple with these questions, or we’ll watch as some of history’s most consequential decisions are made without adequate public scrutiny or debate. We can either repeat the mistakes of climate coverage, or make a concerted effort to do better. The choice, and responsibility, is ours.

  "headline": "AI companies grapple with what it means to be creators of news",
  "summary": "“The media and tech industries, frequently to the dismay of both, are deeply and inextricably intertwined.”",
  "prediction": "As generative AI creeps further into news delivery, discovery, and consumption, both the media and the tech industries will increasingly find themselves in a strange new digital landscape where tech giants aren’t just aggregators of journalism, but  creators  of it. The media and tech industries, frequently to the dismay of both, are deeply and inextricably intertwined. For centuries, technology has offered pathways for media companies to create and distribute their product; media companies, meanwhile, have provided value for new distribution platforms. Today, it’s search giants like Google and social media behemoths like Meta that run the distribution show, printing money off ad dollars and farming data-rich engagement as digital media ventures rely on them for readership. But that landscape is changing. Investments continue to flood the AI bubble, and tech companies throughout Silicon Valley are racing to infuse generative AI into every corner of their businesses. This trend is perhaps nowhere more palpable than in the online search market, where AI is altering existing products like Google Search, the monopolistic entryway to the web that’s now frequently outfitted with an “ AI Overview ” — in short, an AI-generated paraphrasing of search results affixed above search queries — as well as entirely new search products, like OpenAI’s “ChatGPT search” version of its flagship chatbot and the startup Perplexity’s  similar  “Answer Engine.” Powering large-scale AI tools is a practice of setting boatloads of cash on fire, so how tech companies will effectively monetize AI search products remains unclear ( advertising  and  subscription  models are being floated, but the economics are dicey). But with executive enthusiasm for AI showing little sign of slowing down, Google, OpenAI, and others are due to find themselves grappling with an entirely different set of challenges: the editorial responsibilities that come with purveying, instead of merely curating, news and information. Journalism isn’t easy. Reporting is difficult, time-consuming work that necessitates attention to detail. Get those details wrong, and the consequences vary. A mistake like a wrong date could result in a simple — if never fun — correction, while a misleading statement or outright falsehood could change the entire context of a piece of news, which could result in reputational and legal damages to publishers and journalists as well as to reporting subjects. Ensuring proper attribution is also critical; it’s important to know where information is coming from, and to avoid plagiarizing others’ work. Of course, right now, AI tools aren’t actually  reporting  — they’re swallowing the work of human journalists and regurgitating it into something just scrambled enough to evade copyright law. Doing so, though, marks a step for the tech industry beyond offering algorithm-organized links  to  news; editorial choices are inherent to even short news and search summaries, and accurate information and attributions are just as important. As it stands, generative AI tools aren’t reliable agents for  any  of these basic journalistic standards. Google’s AI Overview was  caught spitting out  unhinged medical recommendations and mangling the details of historical events, with the company’s CEO later admitting that there’s  no way of ensuring accuracy  in the product’s current state; a German journalist was  falsely accused  by Microsoft’s OpenAI-powered Copilot tool of being a child molester;  Forbes is suing Perplexity  for copyright theft; and in addition to sourcing and citing  blatantly plagiarized articles , a  new review by Columbia’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism found that  ChatGPT search frequently misattributes direct quotes from publishers —  even those  that have entered into “strategic content partnerships” with OpenAI — in its AI summaries. If a human journalist were consistently making these same errors, they’d probably be out of a job. Will the tech get better? Maybe! Will ongoing lawsuits filed by  media institutions  and AI-defamed individuals against AI companies change the industry’s legal and regulatory landscape? We’ll see! Regardless, tech companies’ role in the information ecosystem is shifting — and with it, their relationship with publishers and the media economy at large. The bottom line: tech companies are no longer just operators of the information  superhighway . Maggie Harrison Dupré  is a senior staff writer for  Futurism . "

  "headline": "AI helps us revisit old journalism territory",
  "summary": "“Some pivots, once deemed infeasible, might be worth a second look using new technology.”",
  "prediction": "The hype wave around AI has peaked (or close to it), but its impact on the industry hasn’t yet been felt. I don’t predict that AI will take us “boldly where no one has gone before.” Instead, it will help us revisit old territory, digging deeper into abandoned wells to uncover untapped value, hidden insights, and opportunities once deemed impractical. What are some pivots, once deemed infeasible, that might be worth a second look using new technology? Remember the early days of the web? Did you use Ask Jeeves, Lycos, or AltaVista? Before Google became the dominant player, search was a competitive space. Some of the best AI projects in 2024 were RAG-powered (retrieval-augmented generation) lookups. Examples include the San Francisco Chronicle’s  Kamala Harris News Assistant , The Washington Post’s  Ask the Post AI  (which followed its  Climate Answers bot ), and Business Insider’s recently released  AI-powered BI search . What makes all of these efforts unique is the dataset that underpins them. News organizations that have or can create unique datasets now have the special ingredients to power a niche search engine that can compete with Google on that topic. Newspapers once dreamed of being the front page of the internet. That never materialized, but if they can create a “niche search” experience that is valuable enough, they could be the go-to source again on certain topics. If these niche search engines succeed, when you have a question, you won’t reflexively “Google it.” There was a time when many news stories had two people involved: the reporter and the writer. The reporter was the stereotypical fast-talking journalist who knew everyone at City Hall. They’d get the scoop and call it in over the phone to the writer. The writer, trained on the keyboard, had a way with words and could put together the story lickety-split. Often the reporter couldn’t write their way out of a paper bag and the writer didn’t know the first thing on how to coax information out of a source. They were a pair. In modern times, the two roles have become one; many journalists even refer to themselves as “writers” first. What happens when the cost to produce content (the text, audio, video, etc.) drastically decreases? Many journalists fear losing their jobs due to this drop in production costs — to which I have two responses. The first response is that there is still another half of the original role of “journalist” that remains integral and relatively untouched by AI. This is the “return of the reporter,” who can get the scoop with  good old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting  — by finding something new. In coming years, journalists will need to intensify and refocus on their ability to discover the “new,” build relationships, understand community trends, and more. They’ll increasingly make their mark with an ability to identify and find new information, rather than how well they can put a string of words together. The height of hyperlocal may have come around 2008, when Patch was the largest attempt at a network of hyperlocal newsrooms. Ultimately, it was unsustainable. While Patch wasn’t beloved by many in the industry, it was  the lack of ROI that ultimately dug its grave . Today, one of the biggest concerns about AI in newsrooms is that it will destroy jobs (see above). But, counterintuitively, AI could actually create more jobs, because the cost of opening up new newsrooms will drop. News deserts exist because covering certain areas is not economically feasible. AI could lower the cost, allowing teams of one to three people to successfully cover an area without additional or back office support. In this case, perhaps, hyperlocal becomes ascendant. Will it be a network, à la Patch? I don’t think so. But we are already seeing small independent “newsrooms” that leverage AI to bring the cost of covering an area down. Perhaps the loss of jobs will be at centralized locations with bloated numbers of staffers covering saturated national issues. If that loss is met with growth in distributed areas, letting journalists focus on being reporters and creating niche data sets, the net gain will be positive. From around 2004 to 2012, “citizen journalism” or “engagement journalism” or anything that made the process of journalism more transparent and participatory was all the rage. There was a deep practical and philosophical push to recognize the audience (the  people formerly known as the audience ), acknowledging  that they often knew more than we did . Much of the fervor of this movement was absorbed by social media, but the ethos has lived on under other names and spaces. One of the biggest hurdles of the citizen journalism movement was the bottleneck of dealing with too much information, combined with a sense of customer service or meaningful engagements that wouldn’t scale without technology. It’s one thing to ask the audience for their input and insight and another to wade through it all to find meaning, while letting audience members understand their role in the process. In 2025, we have an increasingly accessible technology designed to ingest copious amounts of information and devise meaning from it. Just as the cost required to make hyperlocal work has dropped, so has the mental cost required to sift through instances of audience participation, understand an ongoing conversation, and find diamonds in the rough of user feedback. Our ability to do this can meaningfully improve journalism and create paths for the audience to feel connected to our work. We’ve seen the various AI startups that take articles and turn them into videos. I don’t think this pivot will take. I generally believe homogeneous video is not  defensible as a content strategy . Will it be cheaper to make videos? Yes. Will those videos cross the  uncanny valley  and be unique enough for brand affinity to be built on top of them? Probably not. The AI video creation space is  amazing . I’m less enthusiastic about the idea that your average article needs a video asset. Let’s see what Hollywood does with the AI-to-TikTok pipeline before we jump in. Circa was  a unique project and experiment  that, while relatively modest in reach — especially 13 years after its launch — is still a groundbreaking example of rethinking how news and information can be structured. The fundamental idea was to break stories down into “atomic units” that could be threaded together to tell an ongoing story. One could “follow” a story like you follow somebody on TwitteX-thread-sky-adon-hive-truths™. The ex-Circa folks I’ve spoken with agree that the LLM breakthroughs of today would have gotten us much closer to the fundamental vision of Circa. Folks are starting to poke at its edges —  Particle News , among others. Nobody, however, has gone yet for the “end game” of Circa, which was not to produce summaries but to change the nature of how news is organized, closer to an evolving database of information than a series of articles. See my entry above about databases, then imagine how an “article” representation of those databases could reshape every time there was new information from the world or the user. Articles remain the base unit of information, but inside articles are smaller units of information waiting to be plucked out and re-organized to tell stories in a different way. A bit of a repeat from my prediction last year ( “I got 99 predictions but AI ain’t one” ): As cheap and dubious content spreads online, print content, which is expensive to produce, will be seen as more trustworthy. The work required to report, publish, and distribute print media proves an effort — and therefore value — that is harder to fake. I call this  “Proof of Trust,”  inspired by Bitcoin’s “Proof of Work.” Do I think print will rise like a phoenix from the ashes? No. Could there be a pivot, though?  It’s happened before .

  "summary": "“As illiberal regimes take pointers from one another, the sum of their efforts to suppress information is greater than the parts. But two can play at this game.”",
  "prediction": "Around the world, illiberal regimes seek to control the flow of information. But they themselves are often open to certain new ideas — the innovations that other regimes have successfully used to suppress or obscure information that is unflattering or undermines their authority. This mutual emboldening adds another advantage to an already unfair fight, as enterprising regimes advise one another on the latest tools to constrain civil society. But journalists are increasingly fighting back — through collaborations of their own across international borders. Take Latin America, where regimes have learned from one another the finer points of implementing stifling censorship laws. Such prohibitions on free speech have spread like wildfire across countries from Venezuela to Nicaragua to El Salvador, and reporters have discovered overnight that their work is illegal. To combat this, journalists across the region  have joined forces  to hold governments accountable. Through an international nonprofit, CONNECTAS, they have written stories about the Nicaraguan regime’s abuses of power, filing them outside of the country in order to elude legal retaliation. This international network has also republished and amplified such stories across a network of international media outlets, shining a light on the region’s efforts to keep the public in the dark. Elsewhere, in the Middle East, the notorious Bashar al-Assad regime that recently fell in Syria had developed a sophisticated methodology to flout Western sanctions through clandestine collusion with other governments. An international collaboration among Syrian, Dutch, Ukrainian, Romanian, Serbian, and Italian journalists  uncovered  a flourishing trade in phosphate, an ingredient in fertilizer, between Syria and various European countries, likely abetted by Russia. Whether inadvertent or nefarious, this conduct among multiple governments to circumvent sanctions enriched the Assad regime, which had committed human rights atrocities in Syria. It took journalists working across borders to uncover the truth, and the reporting pressured European authorities to beef up enforcement of sanctions on the regime. At our organization,  Global Press , we encourage cross-border reporting, which can upend the carefully controlled narrative that a regime seeks to push domestically. For example, our reporters based in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Uganda collaborated in August  to report  on the alarming spread of a new strain of mpox across the border from DRC to Uganda, hitting children particularly hard. Although Ugandan health authorities sought to suppress the information and urged Ugandans to ignore reports of mpox, our cross-border team was able to deeply investigate and substantiate the disease’s spread into Uganda and educate the public on both sides of the border. Yet the profound impact from international journalism collaborations doesn’t come for free. At Global Press, we’ve recently expanded our operating model to select reporting fellows across multiple countries to report on key themes that span borders, such as civil liberties. As we’ve assembled our new cohort, I’ve come away inspired from each candidate interview — both by each local perspective and by the poignant linkages our fellows can explore across multiple communities. Each of these conversations with reporters highlighted the necessity for fellowships, reporting grants, and other financial aid to support these complex cross-border projects.  As illiberal regimes take pointers from one another, the sum of their efforts to suppress information is greater than the parts. But two can play at this game. In 2025, with the right far-sighted philanthropic support, journalists will continue to find their voices by building bridges internationally — and holding all governments accountable.

  "prediction": "Say what you will about The Washington Post’s much-maligned decision not to endorse a U.S. presidential candidate in 2024, but Jeff Bezos had a point when he wrote  this : “Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Reality is an undefeated champion.” Bezos described the perilously low levels of public trust in the news media.  Gallup’s latest survey  found that only 31% of American adults express at least basic confidence in the mainstream press. It gets worse when you think of it this way: 7 in 10 U.S. adults have little or no faith in what journalists report. This trust shortfall that media people have been wringing their hands about for at least a decade now — well, it’s not just a media problem at all. It is a much bigger challenge facing knowledge institutions and professions as a whole. And in 2025, we will begin to reckon with the trust crisis for what it really is: an indictment of how broken the relationship has become between institutions that create and disseminate knowledge for society and the people they seek to serve. When it comes to knowledge institutions such as medicine, higher education, and journalism, there is an implicit bargain at work: Lay people agree to rely on professionals (e.g., doctors, scientists, lawyers, professors, and, yes, journalists) for expert judgment; and, in turn, these professionals agree to act ethically and in good faith. But that arrangement only works when people believe they can trust these institutions to do the right thing. That belief has hit a breaking point. Universities have lost goodwill in the wake of poorly handled protests and encampments on college campuses; medical professionals have seen their reputation take a hit from the mismanagement of pandemic-era guidance that resulted in growing antagonism toward vaccination and other healthcare interventions; and journalists have been roundly criticized, by Democrats as well as Republicans, for  failing to cover the biggest story of the 2024 election : “the creeping red wave that showed Trump gaining voters in over 90% of America’s more than 3,000 counties.” Such antipathy toward the press is nothing new, and the erosion of trust in other knowledge institutions (especially medicine and higher education) has been slowly gathering for years, but in 2025, we will begin to recognize more fully how intertwined are these trust crises facing the professions. We’ll also see how far the expert class remains from not only grasping the scope of the problem but taking the steps that will be required to solve it. First, people increasingly see these knowledge institutions as “elitist,” disingenuous, and acting primarily out of self-interest rather than in the interests of the public they seek to serve. In my ongoing research with Jacob L. Nelson (see  here ,  here , and  here ), we find that these feelings of frustration toward knowledge institutions cannot be dismissed as partisan reactions (as if this only applied to Trump supporters alone); rather, the anger draws from a deeper disillusionment toward seemingly out-of-touch credentialed experts that may be more widespread than has previously been acknowledged by the professions themselves. So the extent of the challenge calls for a reckoning with reality. To improve their standing among the public, knowledge institutions must think hard about what  authenticity  means in their work. While perceived authenticity has always been an important piece of evaluating trustworthiness,  performed  authenticity has become much more important than ever before because of social media. So while journalists, doctors, and professors assume their expertise is inherently obvious and trustworthy, the people they seek to serve increasingly perceive them and the professions they represent as self-seeking and insincere, especially compared to what may appear to be more relatable and “authentic” sources of information, such as wellness influencers, podcasters, politicians, and others who have built their brands around questioning established, institutionalized forms of knowledge. Fixing this problem won’t be accomplished all in a year (or perhaps even a decade), but in 2025 at least we’ll stop fighting reality.

  "prediction": "When Trump won in 2016, those in journalism circles wrung their hands. How had the media missed it? The field settled on an explanation: America’s elite newsrooms had overlooked  middle  America and neglected  rural  areas. Journalists misunderstood the zeitgeist. Listening  became the new mantra. Employ journalists living in the heartland. Spend time in flyover country. Fund rural startups. This time around, something different is in the air. Instead of calling for journalists to listen to the public, journalists are asking: Why didn’t America listen to us? Platforms deprioritized news, the public avoided it, and partisan influencers captivated people’s attention. Good journalism was out there. But it didn’t reach the public. 2025’s solution isn’t a 2016 “journalism needs to listen to the public” or a 2024 “the public needs to listen to journalism.” Listening is all well and good, but it doesn’t amount to much if you don’t change what you’re doing as a result. You have to motivate people to listen. To meet the moment, journalism needs to meet people where they are. Newsrooms need to consider  why  people aren’t listening and then alter their behavior. They can take a page from what we know about why people don’t listen to each other. If you ask ChatGPT “Why don’t people listen to me?” the responses offer a starting point: (1) tone or delivery, (2) lack of clarity, (3) not being concise, (4) lack of rapport, (5) people don’t see value. Newsrooms could have brainstorming sessions —  with  their audiences — to understand how to tackle issues like these. In looking toward the year ahead, I predict that 2025 will reward newsrooms that act, as opposed to merely listen.

  "summary": "“How can public engagement be harnessed productively, to provide well-rounded feedback that takes into account ideas, sentiment, and knowledge from throughout the community while still providing cogent insight?”",
  "prediction": "It’s hardly revelatory that journalism does not reside at the center of most folks’ lives today. We all now have more access to information, to analysis, and to opinions than at any point in human history, so newsrooms play a less central role on where and how we learn about the world than they did just a few years ago. But while information continues to proliferate, we all agree there are plenty of areas where our experience consuming it is lacking, and where journalism might fill essential gaps. In particular, news organizations have the ability to translate, synthesize, and curate what can too often become noise into meaningful, actionable insights for audiences. This requires, though, for newsroom to embrace a participatory model — an embrace has been slow in coming. No doubt, today’s information environment means the industry has the  potential  to be more participatory than ever before; the methods of communication exist so that journalism can, in theory, act as a living, active process among news organizations and the communities they serve. However, newsroom staffs continue to shrink, even as the territories they cover continue to grow and get more complex. Considering that news organizations have rarely had a handle on serving the full range of voices within the communities they seek to serve to begin with — even when budgets were more robust — it can easily seem out of reach to sustain such acts of participation and to continue to feel the pressure to “stick to the basics,” even as those basics seem to service a dwindling audience I know this feeling all too well. Many of my own experiments over the years — such as launching  a “community liaison” team  at Univision several years ago — have failed to persist beyond the pilot. When they’re attempted, newsroom initiatives aimed at adopting a participatory culture carry significant risks: promises that can’t be followed through on, an endless well of audience feedback that we can all get lost in, conversations that devolve into a toxic cesspool without the necessary support systems for effective moderation. No wonder it feels safer for many to continue to steer away from encouraging participation in any scalable way. Tested platforms exist that invite people to participate in productive ways. For instance, in the past, I’ve had the opportunity to help lead projects that use digital tools such as Polis to help newsrooms gather widespread public feedback. (See more about our pilot with Bowling Green Daily News via  Slate  and our work with  Louisville Public Media .) Such tools can be highly effective at gathering feedback but still provide challenges for journalists and other stakeholders — and for audiences — to make sense of the resulting information that is collected in a way that can drive understanding and action, that can move beyond the individual ideas collected. That’s especially true, again, when resources in most newsrooms have never been more strapped. How can journalists invite participation and use it to help audiences make sense of what is happening in their communities? How can public engagement be harnessed productively, to provide well-rounded feedback that takes into account ideas, sentiment, and knowledge from throughout the community while still providing cogent insight? This is where the promise of new technologies — AI and otherwise — can be especially productive. Discussions about automation in newsrooms have too often focused on continued cost savings and job elimination — for instance, on utilizing conversational AI to generate public-facing stories. But I’m especially interested in how these tools can assist journalists in making use of a wider range of inputs to inform the newsroom’s agenda and the stories they produce. For instance, Innovation Engine is currently working with  Google’s Jigsaw team  to utilize  their new Sensemaking tools  in ways that could help journalists and other stakeholders make efficient use of a significant volume of public feedback. By utilizing new capabilities for data categorization and pattern recognition, data-comfortable journalists — who do not necessarily need to be schooled in significant data analysis — can use these tools to invite public feedback, make sense of it, and provide insights in return. In 2025, I hope we find new ways for newsrooms, key institutions, and audiences to have access to tools that quickly and efficiently help handle what humans struggle to do well — like find patterns amidst a sea of input — and then focus journalists’ energies on what they can do best — that translation, that curation, that synthesis.

  "prediction": "We’re heading into Trump: The Sequel and we know how some of this show goes. It will be the same — but different. We know  people aren’t reading ; social media is full of algorithmic distractions; silly videos are addicting; and  brain rot is real . We know we’ll be contending with news fatigue and many of our audiences will check out. In 2016, many media companies saw a  Trump bump  after the former president’s win. Many now are seeing a  Trump slump . The vernacular online can be very simple and simply put: If you’re producing news,  people aren’t going to like you.  Like, literally. They’re not going to  like  stories about corruption and greed — especially if it involves people in power. They’re not going to  like  posts about officials and their sexual assault allegations. They’re not going to  like  news of pregnant people dying because they’re not getting the care they need. And they’re not going to  like  reports of various rights being stripped from folks on the margins. “Likes” are one of the very few ways audiences send us signals across platforms, and I don’t think we can count on those ❤️s in 2025. In a new world — where our old ideas about how journalism can change the world is out of sync with media’s fragmented ecosystem and people’s short attention spans — how will we engage our audiences around the stories and information we think is important enough to report out and publish? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t to pivot to fluff or dog photos (though I miss the days of guaranteed dopamine hits via  cuteoverload.com ). At  The 19th , we’ve been placing a lot of value in our 1:1 relationships with our audience members. Our newsletter subscribers are among our most highly engaged readers, and that constant contact leads to loyalty and membership. We are looking to these groups, and the products they interact with, as guides — bastions of data to inform experiments to come as we navigate covering the new administration. We’re also really good at explaining things. Service journalism, or news-you-can-use, is easy to understand — a straightforward value proposition. In 2024, a major year for those of us covering politics, The 19th set new records in traffic driven by search because we anticipated what audiences were looking for before, during, and after the election. Some of our most-read journalism in November included stories that  dug into Trump’s policies ,  what’s next for trans people , and  what will happen with the child tax credit . And audiences weren’t just finding a story and moving on. Many signed up for our newsletters; conversions were more than three times above our monthly average during election week. So what about news people might actually  like ? For us, it’s an opportunity to report on joy, to  uplift our audiences  with the news, to have  a newsmaker inspire them . It’s also a priority to report on progress — not just setbacks. And it’s a chance to fortify our closed systems, like newsletters, to foster safe spaces for people to engage with these stories. Our audiences also continue to be interested in history-making moments and learning about “firsts” ( as wild as some of them may be ), so we’re going to keep telling these stories. And our unique lens on gender, politics, and policy means we’re going to continue to do what we do best: adding much-needed context to the national narrative. Please like and share. Julia B.

  "summary": "“Journalism’s fight against disinformation risks irrelevance if it fails to consider how the human mind processes and reacts to both falsehoods and facts.”",
  "prediction": "In 2015, when I founded  Lupa , Brazil’s first organization fully dedicated to combating disinformation, “fake news” was a niche term, Donald Trump was still a reality TV personality, and fact-checking was virtually unknown in Brazil. Back then, our mission was urgent and clear: uncover falsehoods, expose those responsible for it, and demand accountability. The work felt revolutionary — and gave me goosebumps. Now, as Lupa approaches its 10th anniversary, I find myself reflecting on how much has changed — and how much hasn’t. And one harsh realization stands out: The phrase “combating disinformation,” once central to my team’s mission, has become so overused and vague that it’s lost much of its meaning. When everything is labeled “fake news,” nothing truly is. Worse, when those responsible for spreading disinformation claim they’re fighting it too, the term becomes meaningless. Audiences, funders, and even practitioners are left confused, and the measurable progress we’ve sought remains elusive. The global focus on disinformation is undeniable, and that’s a positive step. But the field has become overcrowded, with many players prioritizing performative actions over measurable results. After nearly a decade in this fight, we’re stuck in a cycle of rehashing old strategies and are in desperate need of a reset. How many initiatives have you seen recently promoting prebunks, debunks, fact-checks, or explainers as the ultimate solutions to disinformation? How many media literacy workshops have claimed they could inoculate people against falsehoods? And how many super powerful AI tools? While these initiatives are valuable, they’re no longer innovative. We need to ask ourselves: What’s next? And here’s another uncomfortable truth: In countries like Brazil and the United States, disinformation is no longer an emerging threat — it’s woven into the fabric of daily life. Unlike in 2015, people now recognize disinformation, understand its risks, and express frustration over its effects. Yet many have resigned themselves to its presence, treating it as an inescapable part of the information landscape. And this resignation is alarming. It’s made the “fight against disinformation” feel like an empty promise — a phrase that inspires little action or change. So where do we go from here? How can the “fight against disinformation” evolve in 2025? First, we need a cultural shift within the anti-disinformation community. It’s time to pause, reassess, and invest in deeper research. From a journalistic perspective, this means diving into the thousands of fact-checks, prebunks, debunks, and explainers we’ve already produced to extract actionable intelligence. Second, we must listen to our audiences using techniques from other fields. Polling and research are essential to understanding the disinformation they encounter, the beliefs they hold, and the tools they need to navigate falsehoods — mostly independently. Finally, we need to embrace behavioral science. Journalism’s fight against disinformation risks irrelevance if it fails to consider how the human mind processes and reacts to both falsehoods and facts. By understanding these cognitive dynamics, we can design strategies that truly resonate and drive change. And against all odds, the prospect of incorporating these elements into Lupa’s work gives me back the goosebumps I thought I’d lost. It reminds me that innovation and adaptation are key to staying effective — and to reigniting the passion that first drove this critical work. As we look to the future, we must challenge the status quo, push for smarter solutions, and rebuild the trust that disinformation has eroded. The fight isn’t over — it’s evolving. And with the right tools and mindset, we can ensure it remains impactful in 2025. Cristina Tardáguila  is the founder of  Lupa  in Brazil. "

  "summary": "“In optimizing walled gardens of like-minded folks, we’ve forgotten how to create the conditions for us to safely and openly disagree.”",
  "prediction": "After the 2016 presidential election, I left institutional journalism philanthropy, questioning my ability to reinvigorate journalism’s role in a healthy democracy. Since then, I’ve explored other avenues on how journalism might inspire in people a sense of self-efficacy — the driving factor for civic engagement. But many people have continued to feel even more hopeless, frustrated, and isolated in pursuing the American dream. This is why I believe working towards an explicit North Star goal to build community power is critical. I stay optimistic about the wins I’ve seen (and have been lucky to be a part of) in moving journalism to be more adaptive and to center people over products, as we enter into possibly the most hostile landscape for journalism we’ve seen in awhile. I am also exploring other levers for thriving civic information ecosystems because the journalism industry needs help outside of itself. To redesign news infrastructures with a more explicit goal of building community power (and thereby relevance), I propose the following: Lean into interdisciplinary (namely human behavior and epistemological) expertise in newsrooms.  Most “audience” or “community engagement” roles are really looking for marketing and business development expertise that may help most newsrooms in the short-term, without addressing the core of what could transform the culture of newsrooms for long-term relevance. By getting creative in recruiting expertise such as sociology or other cognitive behavior-related fields, we prioritize the understanding of how communities learn and exchange information as part of a greater whole. For example, I love Data &amp; Society’s new  Trustworthy Infrastructures  call to  Connective (T)issues  run by the dynamic Maia Woluchem. It is an expansive space from and with which journalism institutions and initiatives might also learn and partner. As newsrooms constrict, partner strategically with institutions that already have community trust and credibility, prioritize community-driven interests, and the expertise to inspire empathy for the neighbors we don’t know.  In my current role supporting the resilience of community organizers, I am learning from leaders such as  Rev. Kenneth Nixon  (of  VOICE ) who points out that organizers are “in constant conversation with people most affected by local challenges. We in a sense uncover stories traditional newsrooms often overlook.” Nixon utilizes relational 1:1 meetings that grow into broader civic engagement via institutions that foster a sense of belonging, regardless of ideology and partisanship. This includes structured listening sessions and leaning into difficult conversations to strengthen relationships. Journalists also know how to do these things. But many are forced to use a lot of shortcuts to produce a constant stream of content that undermines how quality journalism is made — by creating connections and meaning between people. Nixon sees that there’s “an untapped opportunity for journalists to partner with broad-based community organizing efforts in ways that could reshape how stories are told and how communities engage with the news.” Organizers, similarly to journalists, know the value of having the grit to show up for people with integrity, in the face of unfair and opaque systems that get in the way of community progress. I’ve already seen powerful local examples where this infrastructural partnership already exists. It’s one of the most dynamic interplay of institutions working to protect community interest that I’ve ever seen. Above all, we need to exercise courageous honesty, so we can be more curious (instead of apathetic), self-reflective (instead of defensive), and open (instead of dismissive).  None of this is rocket science, and for some reason we continue to package this in much mushier terms that don’t require us to listen and translate in ways that require a lot of time, effort, and care. In optimizing walled gardens of like-minded folks, we’ve forgotten how to create the conditions for us to safely and openly disagree. We waste a lot of time being polite as we are being disingenuous, while more and more communities are rejecting institutions that obviously don’t care about or see them. How we help communities build power requires taking communities seriously in a way they can actually feel it. Instead, audiences are creating their own lanes of truth, which for better or for worse as our news infrastructures continue to fragment and swiftly change shape, is an opportunity for change. Those that courageously stay true to public interest goals while staying adaptive to the medium will survive, while those who continue to dismiss and deny, simply won’t.

  "summary": "“In this environment, it is urgent that news organizations defend their editorial independence, rather than capitulate to these attacks in advance. We must cover these perils accurately.”",
  "prediction": "One of the more unsettling reporting experiences I had this year was reading through the House Committee on Education and the Workforce  report  on antisemitism on college campuses, released in October. For the 325-page report on pro-Palestine protest activity, the Republican-led committee (the same group responsible for the  show   trials  of U.S. college presidents over the past year) had managed to wrangle hundreds of pages of private documents from top universities like Harvard and Northwestern, in which administrators weighed how to craft speech policies and respond to student solidarity encampment protests. As a journalist, I’m normally thrilled to see a trove of documents made public. But in this case, the House committee was using the information to accuse college leadership of widespread antisemitism whenever they didn’t endorse a pro-Israel political line. Administrators who discussed making statements condemning both Israel’s military onslaught in Gaza and Hamas’s October 7 attacks were accused of “equivocating” about “terrorism.” University leaders who agreed to condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza as a genocide — a claim advanced by many  scholars of genocide  and  human rights  — were accused of endorsing “specious” and “baseless” claims. The report concluded that the findings called for a “fundamental reassessment of federal support” — i.e. funding — for colleges criticized in the report. Indeed, the panic about campus antisemitism had given the Republicans a  perfect excuse  to advance their crusade of disciplining and defunding schools they have deemed “woke” bastions of the “liberal elite.” The novel twist is they now claim to do so in order to improve the treatment of a minority group. Reading the report, I couldn’t help but think that some version of this treatment could soon be applied to other civil society institutions — including the media. Since October 7, facing an outpouring of  criticism   from  pro-Israel  organizations  and  readers , many news organizations have rushed to do their own policing before politicians even have to ask. Reporters and editors who have posted about Gaza have  lost jobs and contracts  at publications that don’t enforce similar social media rules on other subjects. Under the Trump administration and a federal Republican trifecta, the pressure is likely to increase. A preview of this future is offered in  Project Esther , a “national strategy to counter antisemitism” released by the conservative Heritage Foundation. The plan accuses various progressive pro-Palestine organizations of belonging to a “Hamas Support Network.” It calls for the “dismantling” of such groups and purging of their members from American public life. While the details of how such a plan will be advanced remain hazy, the Project Esther document’s language — which, ironically, itself adopts the structure of classic antisemitic conspiracies by accusing a shadowy coordinated enemy of having infiltrated American institutions, including the media — is chilling. In an example of the type of policymaking we can expect to see more of under such a strategy, the House recently passed HR 9495, the so-called “nonprofit killer” bill, which would allow the government to revoke the tax-exempt status of any nonprofit deemed to be “supportive of terrorism,” without any documentation or due process. Those that stand to be first affected are Palestinian, Muslim, and Arab organizations, the original targets of the legislation. The U.S. government has gone after such groups before in the wake of 9/11, like when the Holy Land Foundation, at the time the country’s largest Muslim charity, was designated a terrorist organization due to  disputed claims  that it had funded aid groups run by Hamas. And if the approach previewed in the House education committee report and Project Esther is any indication, these charges could end up being aimed at a much wider list of targets. As critics have  pointed out , Trump could use such a bill to target his political critics, including indispensable nonprofit publications. In this environment, it is urgent that news organizations defend their editorial independence, rather than capitulate to these attacks in advance. We must cover these perils accurately. In the past year and change, many of those with ostensible commitments to liberal values have abetted the crusade of anti-Palestinian repression. This includes the college presidents who  cowered  in the face of the House members’ bad-faith questioning and the majority of Democratic representatives who  supported an earlier version  of the nonprofit killer bill in the spring, before Trump’s election. It also includes the Anti-Defamation League, which bills itself as a civil rights organization but has long  prioritized   Israel advocacy  over other causes. The ADL  endorsed  the bill and has also pushed universities to  classify  student activist groups as terrorist supporters. For journalists, any approach that validates such measures as legitimate anti-discrimination tactics — rather than naked attempts to strangle speech critical of U.S. foreign policy — may well come home to roost. I’ve written before about how mainstream publications have often  stumbled  in covering the conflation of antisemitism and anti-Zionism. For example, even after several  highly   publicized   controversies  over the ADL’s Zionism, the group’s activities, including its antisemitism  statistics , are still frequently  covered  without reference to the group’s broader political orientation or recent  changes  to its methodology that expand the definition of antisemitism. It’s not surprising, given that the anti-Zionism/antisemitism conflation is endorsed by much of our political leadership, and that reporters want to be sensitive to the concerns of major Jewish groups. But the current threats of repression ought to illustrate the stakes of our coverage. Now is the time to be brave. Mari Cohen  is associate editor at  Jewish Currents . "

  "prediction": "No silver bullet will magically solve our democracy crises. But without viable communication and information systems, the long slog toward reconstructing democratic institutions is rendered insurmountable. Any hope of a democratic future requires that we reimagine and rebuild local media infrastructures. What might this look like during Trump 2.0? While federal-level initiatives are mostly nonstarters for the immediate future, possibilities exist at the state and local levels. Recent years have witnessed a wide range of creative policy measures — in states like  California ,  New Jersey , and  New York  — aimed at bolstering local media. Democrat-controlled state legislatures could redouble efforts toward working with grassroots groups to support local journalism initiatives. Even some Republican lawmakers might wish to salvage what’s left of rural and small-town newspapers. Progressive cities can also build out local media infrastructures, from funding  municipal newspapers  and  subsidizing community media  to guaranteeing  affordable and reliable broadband services . News voucher programs are another exciting arena for  publicly supporting local media , with innovative plans currently taking shape in  Seattle  and  Washington, D.C. A more long-term and ambitious project calls for establishing what I refer to as “ Public Media Centers “: multi-media hubs in public spaces like  post offices , public broadcasting stations,  public access outlets , or  public libraries . A real-world inspiration for this model is the  Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center , a  thriving vestige  of the  Independent Media Center  (IMC or Indymedia) movement of the early 2000s, now housed within a downtown post-office building it purchased nearly 20 years ago. Finally, media owners themselves can do their part by transitioning their commercial holdings into nonprofit or public-benefit alternatives, especially before  hedge funds and their ilk  swoop in to pick apart struggling newspapers. Examples of such alternative ownership structures are found in  The Salt Lake Tribune ,  The Philadelphia Inquirer , and the  LNP newspaper  in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, we must defend what still exists, especially public media. Although U.S. public broadcasting is primarily funded by  private  sources, phasing out the $535 million annual congressional allocation to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as  Elon Musk advocates , would devastate a proven method for  protecting democracy . Public media enjoys  surprisingly high levels of trust  and reportedly  reaches more than 98%  of the country, an information lifeline within America’s  ever-widening news deserts . We should  significantly expand  — not dismantle — this public infrastructure. Clearly, there’s much to do in the coming year and beyond, and it’s tempting to remain in a defensive crouch. But it’s precisely during dark political times when we should articulate bold visions  for the future , forge diverse coalitions, and prepare for a terrain of struggle that anticipates new opportunities for  structural change . Focusing on local media infrastructures to reimagine how they should serve democratic needs is an excellent place to start. Victor Pickard  is the C.

DBEI work has survived being en vogue, falling out of favor, then welcomed back again — several times. My hope is that continuing to be intentional about including audiences we’re missing and people who have long been shut out of pathways to careers in journalism will push us to want to better understand one another — of all backgrounds. It’s one of the greatest challenges in this pluralistic society: trying to navigate change left and right on several fronts amid the advent of social media and smartphones that allow people to self-publish feelings sometimes presented as facts. The DBEI in newsrooms movement is often traced by journalism scholars to when the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders — better known as the Kerner Commission due to the name of its chairman, Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner —  issued a “blistering” report in February 1968 . The report attributed some of the civil unrest at the time to a media industry which wouldn’t hire Black journalists and humanize Black communities, a sentiment many other groups over the years also have expressed. Fast-forward to the year 2025. There were once hopes that our media industry, motivated by the Kerner Commission’s findings, would reflect the nation by now when it comes to racial parity. The American Society of Newspaper Editors pledged in 1978 to create workforces that reflect the nation’s diversity by the year 2000. But the country’s newsrooms failed to meet that deadline — so ASNE set a new goal of 2025. But as recently as 2018, as Nieman Lab reported,  only 17 percent of newsrooms  would even submit their demographic data to researchers. Then ASNE — which reorganized in 2019 into the News Leaders Association —  dissolved  altogether this year, leaving a hole in the journalism association space and the future of its flagship diversity survey in limbo as NLA seeks a new home for it. NLA most recently found that people of color comprised about 22 percent of U.S. newsroom staff, compared to around 42 percent of the U.S. population. So we’re definitely blowing deadline again on that 2025 parity goal — and in journalism, we know that’s not good. Understandably, those from historically marginalized communities and those committed to equity and representation in newsrooms of all backgrounds are doubtful that the outlook will get better anytime soon. However, we should remember that during the first Trump administration, news events — the #MeToo movement, a pandemic which disproportionately affected people of color and the disabled, and the murder of George Floyd and other unarmed Black people — pushed the news industry to reinvigorate its diversity efforts for staff recruitment and retention. Then again came the inevitable  backlash to DEI  — notably in schools, universities, and businesses, with bills passed throughout the nation. Even within the field, some said quietly that some DBEI efforts didn’t bring along everyone with its framing. White and/or cisgender, straight, male folks said they felt left behind, and some of us worried that we needed to figure out how to better engage with those  who felt concerned or nervous  about change in order to  build a stronger coalition . With that whiplash of the past decade, a second Trump administration brings unpredictability for DBEI initiatives in the media industry. Still, with the far-reaching effects of online culture, it doesn’t seem realistic that all progress will be erased. Most  U.S. workers  see good in inclusion work — who doesn’t want to be included? Nearly  four of every five respondents  in a survey by Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism said new efforts to promote DBEI have positively affected the journalism industry. Nearly 87 percent of the respondents were white journalists. In recent years, Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors has  expanded its work on inclusion  and its  DBEI training  remains in demand because journalists want to better cover their communities. And IRE will continue its work. Most folks say they’re turning to what they can control and seek to avoid the panic and anger that may have left them exhausted but not ultimately broken. What I hear is a mix of anxiety, resilience, and curiosity — we are journalists, after all — about the back and forth we’ve seen at the ballot box and in the culture wars in recent decades. What I hear — especially among DBEI educators — is proactive talk about what we can do to  bring everyone along , to move from what can feel like shaming to inspiring others to reconsider their outlook. There are hopes to focus on combating disinformation in news deserts, in predominantly white and rural spaces as much as in immigrant communities where English isn’t the dominant language. Some see the seesaw of election outcomes in recent years as a real opportunity to motivate people of different backgrounds to find common ground instead of icing each other out. Determining who offers the olive branch first seems to cause the most consternation. As someone who is from several historically marginalized communities but has other societal privileges, when I marinate on what’s feasible for DBEI work and self-preservation personally, I often think of a quote by Kevin Nadal, a professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, from  an NPR piece . “Think about your role and your positionality, because if you’re a person with privilege and you could fight a little bit longer, then do it,” Nadal said. “But if you’re a person of a historically marginalized group, we want you to be alive and we want you to be healthy in order to continue this fight toward justice.” At our core, journalists are not easily deterred. Now is another era of testing what we are made of. It’s time to keep up the work, however we each can, in ways grand and subtle. Francisco Vara-Orta  is IRE’s director of diversity and inclusion. "

  "prediction": "The day after the election, ProPublica editor-in-chief Stephen Engelberg published a detailed article telling readers what to expect from the seven-time Pulitzer Prize-winner during the new administration. “At ProPublica, our mantra is that we bring the receipts to every story we publish,”  he wrote . “We are journalists, not leaders of the resistance…As we have done for each presidential administration since 2008, our reporters will begin with basic questions about new government policies: Who is benefiting? Who is suffering? What are the unintended consequences?” ProPublica is not alone in carrying the torch of accountability journalism at a time of doubt about the capacity of longtime legacy stalwarts to do as much of this work. The Marshall Project, Mother Jones/Center for Investigative Reporting, The 19th, Capital B, Grist, and others have demonstrated that national, mission-driven watchdogs can sustain and grow in difficult conditions — and how partnering with local and regional outlets strengthens all involved. Meanwhile local, state and regional nonprofits like CalMatters, Oklahoma Watch, Texas Tribune, Investigate Midwest, Block Club Chicago, and Deep South Today are avid partners themselves as they serve their communities’ needs, no matter which party is in charge. The perils are real, too. Mississippi Today continues to battle  a defamation lawsuit  filed by the state’s former governor, a response to the outlet’s own Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into a massive welfare scandal. “Ours may be a Mississippi case, but the ramifications absolutely could impact every American journalist who has long been granted constitutional protections to dutifully hold powerful leaders to account,” said editor-in-chief Adam Ganucheau. And journalists already do this work on a tightrope, as the bottom can still fall out on a nonprofit news organization with a strong track record of public service, as it did for the Center for Public Integrity. As CJR reported , “María Inés Zamudio, a Chicago-based investigative journalist, lost her job in CPI’s mass layoff in May…she’s had 36 interviews and informational meetings and was in the running for five different jobs that included multiple rounds of interviews and writing tests. But none resulted in a hire — despite her Peabody, Murrow, and other awards, and a history of reporting that exposed wrongdoing and led to institutional change.” And the nonprofit sector more broadly now looks with concern about a bill passed by the House that would allow the Treasury Department to  remove the tax-exempt status  of any nonprofit deemed to be supporting terrorism, a power that scholars and industry leaders fear would be abused. But there is reason for hope as well. The American public, for all of the doubts around trust in the news media, still believes that journalistic scrutiny leads to public officials behaving better, according to  new Pew polling . As new research from the Institute for Nonprofit News indicates, mission-driven nonprofits are built to do this. “The nonprofit model allows news outlets to primarily focus on public service and impact first — letting these organizations spend time and resources on the costly, time-intensive work of uncovering corruption, producing deep explanatory reporting, and connecting people to community services,”  INN published  as part of a new study on audience in October. Amid  lingering concerns  that nonprofits aren’t winning enough audience to make up for the losses sustained by legacy media, it’s clear that local-national partnerships continue to offer an excellent way forward. From ProPublica’s  Local Reporting Network  to The Marshall Project’s  Investigate This! initiative , the resources and reach of national combined with the expertise and connections of local is a powerful formula. And indeed, we at the Allbritton Journalism Institute and NOTUS will launch a State Delegations Initiative in early 2025, partnering with local, state and regional outlets who seek to better hold their elected officials accountable. As ProPublica senior editor Jesse Eisinger told the staff last month, according to Engelberg: “We face the biggest test of our professional lives. Now we get to see if we really meant it when we said we will hold power to account. Will we do so when our subjects have true power on their side and a willingness to use it? We may be harassed. We may be sued. We may be threatened with violence. We may be ignored. Are we just sunshine journalists or are we ready?” Yes, we are ready. Kevin D.

  "prediction": "Hegel, the German philosopher, had a theory of what drives history: conflict between the status quo and a new challenge, resolving (sometimes after much  sturm und drang ) into a stable synthesis. In 2025, I predict that the journalistic status quo and the challengers of digital social media will begin to resolve — into editorially anchored communities. We all know the traditional status quo. In it, journalism is produced centrally and “broadcast” out: over airwaves, through ink and paper, or via ones and zeroes. It is unpersonalized. There may be reactive letters to the editor, or comments tucked below digital articles. Conceptually, the content and the conversation are happening in public, with no access constraints beyond perhaps a transactional paywall. The social topography is a “hub and spokes,” with the journalist at the center of the wheel. Most people are mere consumers or subscribers. The challengers of digital social media are also familiar to us all. Content is produced by decentralized users and flows through a network of nodes and lines. It is heavily personalized. There is rich and chaotic discussion, often outstripping the original content. Conceptually, the conversation is happening in semi-private, with parts of it gated to invitation-only groups. The social topography is a network of networks; there is no center. Most people are users, with agency and purpose. Those two models have been locked in conflict for over a decade. The social media companies have a deep insight: that people want to be more than passive consumers of content; they want to be creators and curators, and have agency and dignity by driving the conversation personally. But the traditional media companies also have a deep insight: that only a strong editorial process, with its checks and balances, can generally produce a coherent and shared understanding of reality. So the two models have gone back and forth. Traditional media points out, often correctly, that social media is rife with misinformation, as users race to the bottom in a competition for outrage and eyeballs. Social media points out, often correctly, that traditional media can be out of touch, condescendingly trying to dictate a narrative, perhaps in a biased way. Traditional media replies that social media often seems unsustainable for society. And social media replies that traditional media often seems unsustainable financially. From this conflict, there is a path forward. A way to combine the strengths of both models into a new, stable synthesis: editorially anchored communities. In editorially anchored communities, the core concept is a community platform — a branded, managed social environment that plays a central role in the ideation, creation, and distribution of content. Think of a private LinkedIn, with immersive branded apps and websites. In those environments, content is produced by both journalists and decentralized users, but the journalistic content is privileged. There is personalization, but only to a point. There is rich discussion, but it is organized and moderated. Conceptually, the conversation is happening in semi-private, always in view of the town square. The social topography is a hierarchy of networks, with journalists at the top. Most people are members — not subscribers, not users, but meaningful parts of something larger than themselves. There are myriad questions, of course, about how such a model will look like in practice. Will journalists be comfortable operating in this sort of context? How will moderation be managed? What revenue models will work best? Can existing community platform tools be deployed more or less as-is, or will heavier customization be needed? Overall, the Hegelian tension has been building between the journalistic status quo and the challengers of digital social media. In 2025, the synthesis will begin to emerge.

  "summary": "“The obligations of journalists extend beyond mere reporting; we must encompass the creation of a genuine forum for discourse.”",
  "prediction": "In the summer of 2016, a chance encounter while walking through downtown Manhattan provided an unexpected lens into the fractured dynamics of American politics and our state of civil discourse. I was engaged in a discussion about the election with a friend when a middle-aged white man approached us, two Black men, and politely asked to join our conversation. Despite the potential for tension, he candidly shared his reasons for voting for Donald Trump. He recounted the devastating impact of losing his full-time job during the Great Recession — plunging him into years of underemployment. His disappointment with what he perceived as Barack Obama’s unfulfilled promises of economic improvement and letting “bad bankers go free” left him disillusioned with traditional political avenues. While he expressed an earnest respect for Hillary Clinton, he explained “I know if she wins, nothing will fundamentally change in my life. I’ll probably never get back on my feet into my 60’s. With Trump there is a chance. He might be a disaster, but he might be great. I’m willing to take the risk.” This experience deeply resonated with me. It helped me understand for the first time a perspective of political discontent driving many to seek change through unconventional candidates. This encounter was not merely about one man’s political choice; it reflected a deeper narrative of frustration and aspiration shared by countless individuals across the country. This conversation challenged my understanding of why individuals might turn to a candidate they perceive as a disruptor, regardless of the controversies surrounding him. Voters often respond to lived experiences of economic hardship, and their decisions cannot be reduced to mere ideological alignments. It illuminated the significant role of civil discourse in our society and the pressing need to create environments that foster meaningful conversations and understanding. The man’s willingness to share his story — candidly — emphasized how vital it is for us to establish an open dialogue where different viewpoints are not only heard but respected. Not everyone is going to be willing to bravely tell a stranger their potentially contrarian view. And not everyone will be receptive and respectful as me and my friend were in listening to this stranger. And as the results of that election and this year’s revealed, that stranger’s perspective was not novel. Most public conversations are represented by the loudest and most polarized voices, while the majority of people who hold complex and nuanced views remain silent. I call these people “The Quiet Majority,” which refers to the majority of people who do not engage in public discourse for several reasons including social punishment, career vulnerability, and the fear of being mislabeled as hateful. Most people share their true thoughts in what I call “trust spaces.” The publications of the future that will earn and maintain the respect and credibility of the public across ideologies and perspectives will be those that find ways to cultivate physical and digital trust spaces in the public square and welcome the quiet majority. What is vital here is the recognition that civil discourse can only flourish in environments where trust is cultivated. The ease with which individuals feel comfortable sharing their viewpoints stems from their perception of the safety of their environment — both physical and digital. Trust spaces are environments where individuals feel secure enough to share their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment or retribution. These spaces foster emotional safety and encourage open dialogue — establishing the foundation for effective civil discourse. These are not always formal spaces. In fact, I believe the most common trust space exists on messaging platforms. They are our group chats composed of our closest family and friends, who we feel comfortable enough to disagree with, and whom we will also not disown for sharing ideas we may find troublesome. From 2019 to 2023, I researched what I coined private digital messaging networks (PDMNs). These are closed messaging groups where communities of people share culturally relevant information related to some of their most salient identities. They can be Discord channels, Slack communities, and the platform I focused on the most, WhatsApp groups. My original intent was to explore messaging as a news delivery service for immigrant diaspora groups. Communities of people with especially salient identities, that are not served by a well funded and consistent media, find ways to form groups and share collected content that is culturally relevant. I studied immigrant diaspora groups, but PDMNs could also be for gamers, red pill-ers, etc. My experiences studying immigrant diaspora WhatsApp groups during the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the urgent need for such trust spaces. These digital channels often became battlegrounds for misinformation and fear. This left participants desperate for safe environments where they could share opinions and seek clarity that was culturally relevant and shared by a close connection, and therefore more trustworthy. Participation in these informal messaging groups revealed a stark reality. People were eager to share thoughts within smaller, trusted circles, but shied away from broader platforms where they risked being marginalized for their views. At Harvard, I observed how student engagement in dialogic spaces revealed another layer to this complicated issue. Many students intentionally avoided public forums due to fears of being labeled or ostracized. Their readiness to communicate in trusted circles stood in stark contrast to their reluctance in broader discussions aimed at dialogue. This alarming gap emphasizes the critical need to create an environment conducive to open, candid exchanges. During informal conversations, students articulated their rich perspectives, often laden with nuance, yet when confronted with public or even open platforms, they withdrew. Their concerns centered around potential reputational harm, the risk of backlash, and fear of being classified with derogatory labels such as “phobic” or “bigoted.” This trepidation illustrates the profound impact of trust — or the lack thereof — on civil discourse. Fear of these consequences transcends political affiliations and is prevalent in various discussions across academic institutions, workplaces, and community forums. Many individuals hold valuable insights but hesitate to voice them due to the potential backlash that may follow. What do we do if our views do not fit within the dominant narratives? What occurs when someone feels the need to carefully navigate conversations to avoid being labeled negatively, and omits valuable insight out of fear? What happens is we all lose. We lose because someone we trust might be the one who effectively allows you to see an issue in a different light. But if we collectively stay silent, we rob our communities of our best ideas and the opportunity for us all to grow collectively. The obligations of journalists extend beyond mere reporting; we must encompass the creation of a genuine forum for discourse. Journalists can pave the way for healthier civic engagement by finding ways to foster spaces that encourage complex and nuanced dialog. Establishing these trust spaces becomes crucial in bridging divides and nurturing a more inclusive democracy. As we navigate the complexities of contemporary society, the responsibility to engage in open dialogue rests with all of us. By actively creating trust spaces, we can foster an environment where every voice is heard and every opinion respected. In doing so, we enhance the fabric of our democracy, ensuring that our civic conversations reflect the rich diversity of experiences that shape our collective narrative. Only then can we pursue solutions rooted in understanding, bridge gaps, and cultivate a united society. The opportunity for transformation lies within our grasp; we need only choose to embrace it in our day-to-day interactions, inviting all perspectives to the table. If we want to hear the quiet majority, we must prioritize listening. Michael Rain  is the founder of  ENODI  and senior fellow in civil discourse at Harvard’s  Safra Center for Ethics . "

  "prediction": "[Click here for English version.] Soy latina, mexicana, migrante y fronteriza… y desde el 1 de noviembre también ciudadana estadounidense. Tardé 18 años. Fue un camino largo, doloroso y costoso. Fue una travesía de silencios, como los muchos que adoquinan el tan prostituido término del “sueño americano”. Regué las flores que hoy huelo con muchas lágrimas, así como lo siguen haciendo millones de migrantes que siguen en una situación irregular, porque nadie les ha tendido un puente legal para la tierra en la que han echado raíces y la otra donde tienen sembrado el corazón. Veo mi reflejo y veo a mi comunidad. Tenemos surcos en la frente y en las manos. Somos la resiliencia, una palabra que me conmociona porque admiro la fuerza y condeno la amenaza. Somos así, con los contrastes que vendrán en 2025. Somos esa luz que brilla a pesar de las sombras. Somos las historias que dejaremos de callar. Empiezo con la mía… y escribiremos los primeros párrafos de la nuestra para el año que entra. Cuando pienso en la frontera, me voy a casa. A la mente me vienen los saguaros floreciendo y el olor de tacos de carne asada, los perros ladrando, los autos que hacen fila para cruzar de un lado a otro, pienso en mi infancia y mi madurez, en la compra de mi vestido de novia y el nacimiento de mis cuates. Para mí la frontera es amor, familia, sudor, calor intenso, música a todo volumen, contrastes, muchas sombras, sí, pero también mucha luz. Yo soy fronteriza. Soy mexicana porque nací en un pueblo mágico, en una tierra donde desde pequeña me enseñaron a soñar. Soy de una ciudad muy muy chica en el norte de México, cerca de la frontera, donde aún está mi familia y mis muertos, donde tengo anclado el corazón. Mi querido Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, México. Soy latina por mi herencia hispana, por el idioma que hablo, por las tradiciones milenarias que traigo en la sangre, en la piel y en la maleta, porque soy uno de esos 52 millones que vivimos en Estados Unidos, en la luz y en las sombras. Y soy migrante. Aquí es donde quizá me reconocí, me descubrí y me encontré. Me crie con el privilegio de cruzar fronteras de ida y vuelta. Veía a Estados Unidos siempre como un lugar de paso, como un destino temporal, por días y horas, antes de volver a casa. Hasta que migré. Llegué en 2006 con el ímpetu que da el amor y la ignorancia de los muchos privilegios que me acompañaron en este camino. Cambié mi visa de turista por una de esposa y después a una de trabajo. Recorrí el sistema migratorio y sus múltiples visas de empleo, y descubrí que a veces la lucha por la legalidad es también una forma de esclavitud moderna. Trabajé siempre más duro que los demás para “merecer” el patrocinio de la visa y lloré no sé cuántas noches cuando se iba a vencer, cuando habría que renovar el permiso de trabajo, cuando tenía que justificar ser y estar aquí en una nación que sentía siempre ajena, prestada, en donde me convertía a ratos en impostora. Sé que esto que estoy compartiendo es muy personal y escojo hacerlo porque quiero contarles también de las muchas batallas que libré en silencio cuando todo parecía que estaba bien y no era así. Era como vivir cuesta arriba: sin descanso, sin tregua, sin poder bajar el paso ni soltar la carga. Como periodistas latinos y, más los que trabajamos en español, vivimos siempre cuesta arriba, en contra de la gravedad, deseando que los sueños nos eleven a la cima. Hay caminos en los que el esfuerzo nos deja sin aliento y el cansancio hace que nos tiemblen las piernas y se nos acalambren los deseos. No paramos. Apretamos el paso y dejamos que el orgullo nos empuje. Siempre viendo al horizonte. Se nos ampollan los pies y el corazón. Flaqueamos, pero la voluntad y las ganas nos abrazan. Un aliento basta para llenar el corazón y seguir. Lo sé muy bien, me he caído y me han tumbado. Yo, que me he dedicado a contar historias ajenas, me cuesta mucho salir de mis sombras para desnudar mis vulnerabilidades con una comunidad que también me ha enseñado las suyas. Por años trabajé sin parar, 14 horas diarias casi los 7 días de la semana para demostrarles a mis jefes que merecía estar aquí, que valía la pena que me patrocinaran la visa, que de verdad quería echar raíces en este lado del muro y para probarle a Estados Unidos que me estaba ganando mi sitio. Es decir, me dediqué a probar que valía la pena, a otros y a mí misma. Y en un sistema migratorio obsoleto y enmarañado, donde se tiende a premiar el sufrimiento, me gané la medalla de mi libertad. Ahora soy ciudadana… y sigo siendo migrante. Mi definición del éxito fue cambiando muchísimo con mi caminar migrante. Al principio confundí éxito con premios, dinero, tener mi firma en medios grandes y créditos en documentales internacionales. Lo logré. Pero hoy entiendo que eso es solo un cómplice del ego y que el verdadero éxito es en poder ser quien soy, estar donde estoy y tener los brazos llenos de amor. El éxito es en realidad ese momento que nos quita el aliento, que nos hace sentir que dejamos de respirar un instante solo de emoción, es justo lo que siento en este momento, el corazón alborotado de gratitud y emoción. Soy una mujer afortunada. Cuando el mundo se iba al carajo con una pandemia, emprendí. Me convertí en una fundadora con mucho de periodista y un saldo rojo de empresaria. Mientras recorro este camino me veo en pocos espejos. No hay tantas latinas, con acento, migrantes, luchonas y huérfanas de complejos en este andar. En las posiciones de liderazgo hay muy pocas que se parecen a mí; en los puestos de poder casi nadie me representa. Y ese es uno de los principales problemas. La toma de decisiones recae siempre en los hombros del privilegio. Ahí también se asientan los fondos y los presupuestos. El 2025 no me asusta, me emociona. ¡Qué buena hoja en blanco tenemos para apoderarnos de la pluma y recuperar nuestras narrativas! El próximo año representa una de esas encrucijadas en donde uno escoge qué camino seguir. Sí, el 2025 será el año en el que ejercitemos el músculo de encontrar el júbilo y la magia en el periodismo. Será el año de los periodistas migrantes que por fin echamos raíces y de luchar por aquellos que aún no encuentran la paz. El presente y el futuro del periodismo es el que se anima a cruzar fronteras; que se desvela y se desnuda, que se permite ser vulnerable, opinar, expresar y querer cambiar. Es colaborativo, bilingüe, transfronterizo y se parece a mí: humano, con acento, que vibra y hace temblar. También será el año de los periodistas que tuvieron que construirse una mesa cuando no cabían o no les daban espacio en una ajena; de una comunidad que no necesita que le den voz, porque ya la tiene y necesita ser amplificada; es de los periodistas bilingües y biculturales que trabajan en las sombras, en la precariedad laboral y aun así marcan la diferencia una historia a la vez con lo muy poco que tienen a la mano; de los que tenemos ganas de experimentar y de innovar, de salir de lo tradicional, de escuchar y crear, de los que no tenemos miedo de reinventarnos y cuestionarnos porque nuestra audiencia ahí está. Será el año de aquellos que se atrevan a conversar y devolverle el diálogo al periodismo como lo hacemos en Conecta Arizona. El 2025 será el año de los medios de comunicación innovadores, inspiradores, poco tradicionales y muy comunitarios. Nosotros en Conecta Arizona le devolvemos de a poco el diálogo al periodismo a través de cientos de cafecitos en WhatsApp, en la radio y en persona. Estamos abriendo camino para que vengan más, un camino más ancho en el que podamos caminar al lado y no siempre detrás. Pero eso requiere voluntad. Si algo nos enseñó el 2024 es dejar de suponer y predecir. Es hora de que como periodistas recordemos por qué empezamos a contar historias. Es el año en el que guardemos silencio y escuchemos con todos los sentidos; que reconozcamos que nuestras historias son tan fuertes como nuestra ética y que recordemos que no son los ratings ni las estadísticas, sino los humanos los que provocamos impacto. Las palabras importan, y quienes las escriben incluso más. Pero escuchar es algo difícil cuando estamos acostumbrados a resolver. Hay silencios que gritan, que incomodan, sacuden y causan malestar. Dialogar es igual de desafiante, pero ser el testigo de una conversación sin prejuicios es un verdadero acto heroico. Moderar un grupo polarizado también es un acto de amor, es tender un puente y descubrir la voluntad de aprender en medio de una tormenta que arrasa. Cuando nuestra comunidad está contrariada, es una prueba de fuego entre el respeto y la libertad de expresión, o la paciencia y las frustraciones. Mantener la cabeza fría cuando el corazón está desbocado es de lo más difícil que he hecho y confieso que ha valido la pena, a pesar de ese nudo en el estómago que me obliga a replantearme quién me tiene haciendo esto ¡y en WhatsApp! Las conversaciones difíciles son otro músculo que tenemos que ejercitar, pero que en cuanto lo movemos nos deja adoloridos. Para evitar la molestia, lo más fácil sería la censura, dejar de hacerlo, ignorarlo todo y dejar que las diferencias fluyan, pero entonces nos convertiríamos en otro agujero negro de noticias; además, no nos gustan los atajos. Para crecer, hay que andar. Para madurar, hay que dialogar. Para construir, hay que escuchar. Para fortalecer, hay que perseverar. El pensar diferente no significa que nos declaremos la guerra; no somos enemigos, sino humanos. En realidad, esos contrastes son los que nos obligan a enfrentarnos con nuestros demonios. El desafío también es lo que pasa cuando nos cuestionamos a nosotros mismos y nuestros privilegios como periodistas. Todas las opiniones tienen una historia de fondo, ¿cuál es la que expone en palabras? Algunas deberían ser amplificadas y otras simplemente dejarse morir sin eco. ¿Qué pasa también cuando nuestras identidades se mezclan? ¿Cuál es la identidad que se impone cuando tenemos tantas? ¿Cuál es el común denominador cuando nos jalan los extremos? La empatía, la escucha activa y el guardar las espadas de la opinión son parte del antídoto contra la polarización; serán los superpoderes más importantes para el 2025. La vida no se trata de colgarse medallas al cuello y ganar a cuesta de todo… deberíamos gastarnos el tiempo también en crear puentes de entendimiento. Hay que diferir con respeto. Por eso sé que el 2025 será nuestro año. Los medios de comunicación comunitarios e independientes nos hemos convertido en pequeñas luciérnagas de la democracia cuando se apagan las luces de las grandes corporaciones que dejan de invertir en el periodismo local. Somos pequeños reflejos de esperanza en jardines noticiosos que se hacen cada vez más áridos frente a la sed de información en español. No somos un espejismo, somos un oasis en peligro de extinción. Pero somos unos cuantos los que nos aferramos, porque vale la vida y la pena, lo vale la democracia. Sí, porque los medios comunitarios florecemos como lo hace el desierto: a pesar de todo. I am Latina, Mexican, migrant, and from the borderlands. And since November 1, I am also a U.S. citizen. It took 18 years — a long, painful, and costly journey. It was a voyage of silences, like the many that pave the overused term “American dream.” I watered the flowers I smell today with countless tears, as millions of migrants continue to do — those who are both stuck and untethered because no one has extended a legal bridge between the land where they have put down roots and the one where their hearts are planted. I see my reflection and I see my community. We bear wrinkles on our foreheads and hands. We are resilience — a word that unsettles me because I admire strength but condemn threat. This is who we are: the light that shines through the shadows. We are the contrast of 2024 and 2025. We are the stories that we will no longer silence. As we write our first paragraphs for the coming year, I’ll start with mine. When I think of the border, I think of home. In my mind, I see blooming saguaros and smell carne asada tacos. I hear dogs barking and cars lining up to cross from one side to the other. I think of my childhood and my early adulthood — of buying my wedding dress and the birth of my twins. For me, the border is love, family, sweat, intense heat, loud music. It has its contrasts and shadows, yes — but also so much light. I am fronteriza. I am Mexican because I was born in a magical town where I was taught to dream from a young age — a very small city in northern Mexico near the border where my family and my ancestors still are, where my heart is anchored: my beloved Magdalena de Kino, Sonora. I am Latina because of my Hispanic heritage — the language I speak, the millennial traditions carried in my blood, skin, and suitcase. I am one of those 52 million Latinos who live in the United States — in both the light and the shadows. And I am an immigrant. This is perhaps where I truly identify with; where I discovered and found myself. Growing up with the privilege of crossing borders back and forth, I always saw the United States as a place of passage — a temporary destination for days or hours before returning home. Until I migrated in 2006 with the impetus of love and ignorance about the privileges that accompanied me on this path. I exchanged my tourist visa for a spousal visa, and then a work visa. Navigating through the immigration system’s labyrinthine processes — employment visas and renewals — I discovered that sometimes even trying to gain legal status can feel like modern slavery. I worked harder than others to “deserve” visa sponsorships. Many nights were spent crying when deadlines loomed — when work permits needed renewal or when justification was required for staying in a nation that often felt foreign and borrowed. At times, it made me feel like an impostor. I know what I’m sharing is deeply personal. But I choose to share it because it reflects countless battles fought silently when everything seemed fine but wasn’t. It felt like living uphill: without rest or respite — unable to slow down or lessen the burden. As Latino journalists — especially those working in Spanish — we perpetually live uphill against gravity, hoping our dreams will lift us to the summit. The paths we tread leave us breathless; fatigue makes our legs tremble while our desires cramp. Yet we don’t stop. We quicken our pace as our pride pushes us forward toward horizons that blister our feet and hearts alike. I know this well — I have fallen and been knocked down countless times. As someone dedicated to telling others’ stories, it is difficult to bare my vulnerabilities before a community that has also shared theirs with me. For years, I worked tirelessly — 14-hour days nearly seven days a week — to prove to employers that sponsoring my visa was worth it; to prove to the United States that I belong here; to prove to myself that I was enough. In an obsolete immigration system where suffering seems rewarded, I earned my medal of freedom. Now, as a citizen, I remain an immigrant. My definition of success has evolved throughout this migration journey. At first, success meant awards, money, bylines in major media outlets, or credits in international documentaries. I achieved all of them. But today, success means something deeper: to be myself, to be where I am, and to be held in arms full of love. True success is found in moments that take your breath away — moments like this one when gratitude and excitement stir your heart. I am lucky. When the world spiraled into chaos during the pandemic, I became an entrepreneur — a founder with a passion for journalism but little business acumen and few financial safety nets. Walking this path, I see few reflections of someone like me: Latina, with a thick accent, an immigrant — a fighter unburdened by complexes, yet navigating spaces where leadership rarely looks like me and decision-making rests on the shoulders of privilege. Funding and budgets follow suit. 2025 doesn’t scare me — it excites me. A blank page is waiting for us to reclaim our narratives. The coming year represents a crossroads — a time to choose paths deliberately. It will be the year for immigrant journalists who have put down roots, and the year to fight for those still searching for peace. The present and future of journalism crosses borders — it stays up late; it dares to be vulnerable; it collaborates bilingually across cultures; it looks human — with accents that vibrate and voices that tremble. It looks like me. It will also be the year for journalists who built their own tables when they were excluded from others’; for communities who don’t need to be given a voice, but have theirs amplified; for bilingual journalists working tirelessly despite job insecurity — making an impact story by story with limited resources. 2025 will be the year of innovative, inspiring, unconventional, and very community-oriented media. It will be the year that we must listen and bring back dialogue to journalism. At  Conecta Arizona , we are restoring dialogue within journalism through hundreds of WhatsApp coffee chats as well as radio broadcasts and face-to-face conversations. We are paving the way for more to come, a wider path where we can walk side by side and not always behind. But listening, building and trust requires will, passion and patience. If 2024 taught us anything — it’s to stop blindly assuming or predicting outcomes. It’s time that we remember why we began telling stories: not for ratings but for humans whose words provoke impact. Words matter, and who writes them matter even more. Listening is hard when we’re used to looking for a problem to fix. But dialogue requires heroic patience, amid deafening silences and polarizing divides. Having a difficult conversation is also an act of love. When our community faces conflict, moderating a discussion can be a personal litmus test between respecting someone’s freedom to expression and losing your patience and airing your frustrations. Keeping a cool head with a racing heart is one of the most difficult things I’ve done. But it has been worth it, despite that knot in my stomach that forces me to rethink why I’m doing this, and on WhatsApp! We have to exercise the muscles of difficult conversations, but as soon as we do, it leaves us sore. To avoid that discomfort, the easiest thing would be to stop doing it, to ignore everything and let differences flow, but then we would become another black hole of news; and besides, we don’t like shortcuts. To grow, we must walk. To mature, we must dialogue. To build, we must listen. To strengthen, we must persevere. Thinking differently is not a declaration of war; we are not enemies. We are humans. In reality, these differences are what force us to confront our demons. When we question ourselves and our privileges as journalists, the challenge is in what we do next. All opinions have a backstory, but which ones should get published? Some should be amplified and others simply left to die without echo. What also happens when our identities mix? Which identity prevails when we have so many? What is the common denominator when extremes pull us? Empathy, active listening, and keeping the swords of opinion sheathed are part of the antidote against polarization; they will be the most important superpowers for 2025. Life is not about hanging medals around your neck and winning at all costs, but about building bridges of understanding. I know that 2025 will be our year. Community and independent media have become small fireflies of democracy when the lights of large corporations that stop investing in local journalism go out. We are small reflections of hope in news gardens that are becoming increasingly arid in the face of thirst for information in Spanish. We are not a mirage, we are an oasis in danger of extinction. But there are a few of us who cling on, because democracy is worth the effort and the struggle. We bloom like desert flowers — against all odds.   Maritza L. Félix  is the founder of  Conecta Arizona .  "

  "summary": "“Free content will be increasingly synonymous with AI slop and other low-quality content that’s barely worth anyone’s time to read, let alone pay to advertise on.”",
  "prediction": "For years, Vox prided itself on being free, saying that this universal, ad-supported access was a key part of its mission. Then the pandemic came and ad sales slumped, and Vox started  asking readers  for contributions “to help keep our work paywall-free.” Multiple rounds of layoffs later (one of which, full disclosure, got me), this year Vox finally put up a  partial  paywall “ to help us weather the notoriously fickle advertising market .” Another paywall holdout bites the dust. It’s not just Vox; fellow Vox Media property The Verge,  followed suit  a few months later. CNN and Reuters  recently announced  their own paywall plans. And then we have BuzzFeed. Not too long ago, it seemed like the paywall-free future of online journalism, with its ability to wring maximum traffic out of benevolent Big Tech overlords. Now those overlords aren’t so benevolent, BuzzFeed News is gone, and BuzzFeed spent 2024  selling itself   for parts  and pivoting to AI. It still owns HuffPost, somehow, and HuffPost is still sans paywall…and  asking  for voluntary contributions to try to keep it that way. Thanks to the rise of generative AI and the fall of social media-fueled, algorithmically-driven traffic, there’s a better case than ever to be made that at least some of your content should be behind a paywall. Traffic sources that many publications came to rely on have dried up. Meta is now doing its utmost to push news out of everyone’s Facebook, Instagram, and Threads feeds. I don’t think I need to say more about how Twitter’s relationship with journalists and journalism has changed, but feel free to search “lazy linking” for the latest example of this. If you look it up on Google, the answer will probably come to you in the AI Overview (powered by ~*~Gemini~*~) that Google has forced atop into everyone’s search results. Scroll way down for the actual search results, but good luck finding a quality, human-produced website amid the  ever-increasing pile of AI slop  that search engines can’t or won’t detect and deprecate. Which brings me to the other big reason why publishers who resisted paywalls for so long are putting them up now. Free content will be increasingly synonymous with AI slop and other low-quality content that’s barely worth anyone’s time to read, let alone pay to advertise on. A paywall tells readers that there’s something behind it that’s worth paying for. Readers who once balked at the thought of paying for news may well find the prospect more attractive as the free alternatives go away or get worse. The cruel irony, of course, is that so much journalism and so many journalism websites helped create the AI slop producers, whose bots scraped the “open web,” copyrighted news websites very much included, for training data. One way publishers can get any kind of return on the value they unknowingly provided to AI companies? Stop providing it for free. Paywalls can be a way to stop the scraping — not a foolproof one, but let’s assume that paywalls get better at blocking scrapers now that we see the need for them to do so — and then publishers can license that content to AI companies. Which is exactly what’s happening right now, and hopefully will not (but probably will) end the same way those news partnerships with social media companies did. Readers who are willing and able to pay will get content that they made an affirmative choice to consume, rather than something they came across by passively clicking on it (full disclosure again: I work for a very-much-paywalled news site now). Publishers will have to make sure they’re giving readers their money’s worth. Maybe that’s addictive word puzzles, maybe it’s market-leading coverage of a certain niche, maybe it’s really talented writers, maybe it’s scoops, maybe it’s investigations, maybe it’s opinions and analysis. And publishers will also have to figure out what kind of paywall works best for the audience they have or want. That might mean paywalling everything, or it might mean a “freemium” model that balances the need to have some readers paying for their journalism with the reality that not all of them will. Yes, there will be a lot of people who can’t or don’t want to pay for news. They’ll be getting it from the diminishing number of free news sites, the scraps that paywalled sites throw at nonpaying readers, and an exponentially growing pile of AI slop, misinformation, and “something I saw/heard on social media/Reddit/some guy’s podcast.” We have an idea of the kinds of problems this information diet causes, but we probably don’t yet know how bad things can get. In the end, we’ll all get what we paid for. Sara Morrison  is a correspondent at  The Capitol Forum . "

  "summary": "“We can’t be intimidated by the attacks that are coming. We have to do the rigorous accountability journalism that pisses off people in power.”",
  "prediction": "I expect journalists to be consumed in the coming year with the riddle of how to break through to people who don’t read or trust them. Easy answers elude our industry. We rightly bemoan the gutting of local news, and the sense of connection and trust the best of these places were able to build. Truth is, though, that some traditional local outlets only spoke for and about certain parts of their communities, leaving others alienated. But I’ve been heartened by the grit and ambition of local news organizations like  Outlier  in Detroit,  Mississippi Today,   Flatwater Free Press  in Nebraska, and  Arizona Luminaria , to name but a few.  Here at  The Marshall Project , we’ve been experimenting for years with how to reach out to people who don’t ordinarily receive fact-based information or trust its source — the incarcerated, their families, people who live with fear both of crime and over-policing, people with literacy challenges and people who turn to unconventional or fragmented networks for information and help. We’ve found that it’s extremely powerful to ask communities what they don’t know and what they want to know about their criminal justice system, and then build some portion of our journalism — investigative, engagement, and service — around it. One example is judges’ guides for  Cleveland/Cuyahoga County  in Ohio and  Jackson/Hinds County , Mississippi, which have been among our most-shared, most-read local products — a direct response to people who felt they didn’t understand who they were voting for even though local judges wield so much power over their fates.  That means finding people where they congregate — churches, community centers, Facebook groups — and convening public meetings to hear what people want to know. It means distribution and shared reporting through an extensive network of local partnerships, in outlets that have credibility even in small pockets of the community. It means collaborating with outlets like the Documenters, citizens who are trained to report on local government meetings and do  interviews , as trusted messengers. It means going on local radio shows for open Q&amp;As. At The Marshall Project, we decided to leave Twitter and work to find other outlets, be they Reddit (moderated), TikTok (if it’s still legal), or areas still to be discovered.  We now translate complex written investigations into more digestible forms, whether  video , fliers, animations, 5-things summaries, or  illustrated explainers . And in our new  Investigate This!  Project, we offer databases, investigative expertise, guidance on how to reach and interview incarcerated people and easy to use tool kits for local journalists across the country.  Many news outlets are experimenting along these lines, in inspiring and surprising ways, across the country. It’s an analogue of the grass-roots work done by community organizers — but without a partisan or prescriptive mission.  I hope and believe more journalists will approach their work with humility, compassion, openness and experimentation in the coming year. We can’t be intimidated by the attacks that are coming. We have to do the rigorous accountability journalism that pisses off people in power. We have to understand better how not only to share our work, but convince people of its profound value — now more than ever.  Susan Chira  is editor-in-chief of  The Marshall Project . "

  "summary": "“When left-brain thinkers dominate, media products face a value proposition crisis — funnels and operations are optimized, but creativity is stifled.”",
  "prediction": "The real divide in newsrooms isn’t between editorial and advertising — it’s between left-brain (math, logic) and right-brain (creativity, intuition) functions. Hidden left-brained infrastructure underpins modern media businesses. It enables editors, product managers, brand strategists, developers, and sales teams to focus on higher-order, right-brain problems. In print publishing, this hidden infrastructure manages printing, sales, and distribution. On YouTube, this hidden infrastructure is the algorithm. For logged-out websites, this hidden infrastructure is Google SEO and Discover. I’ve observed this dichotomy firsthand. At The Times of India, I led editorial product until 2021. Since 2022, I’ve been building recommendation models.  When left-brain thinkers dominate, media products face a value proposition crisis — funnels and operations are optimized, but creativity is stifled. Conversely, when right-brain thinkers dominate, you get overly creative editorial products — like an Indo-Tibetan fusion restaurant in Ireland. Unique? Yes. In demand? No.  Today’s media products resemble the feature phones of the pre-iPhone era — a patchwork of ideas with obsessive focus on visual differentiation. Nokia’s downfall stemmed from similar misplaced priorities. Once platformization worked with the iPhone, all phones adopted the flat glass slab form. Competition shifted to specs and algorithms, while the creativity migrated to apps. The best of those apps were eventually integrated into the platform. Platformization works because, once self-learning AI stabilizes, it drives growth independently, eliminating the need for constant operations. This stability compounds over time, allowing teams to concentrate on the next major release, raising the baseline while safeguarding prior gains. The process is slow, deliberate, and sustainable. The compounding gains from AI are so vast that visual differentiation seems less appealing. Similarly, once platformization worked for Big Tech, all media feeds standardized their UX down to feeds and search. My prediction for 2025 is that news conglomerates will reorganize into two business units: On-platform, the left-brainers will platformize: With the hidden infrastructure settled, the right-brainers operate on the platform, as they would on YouTube, Google Ad Manager, or the iOS App Store: Balancing left-brain efficiency with right-brain creativity through platformization will define the media industry’s success in 2025 and beyond.

  "author": "Paul Cheung",
  "headline": "Journalism faces its Kobayashi Maru moment",
  "summary": "“Concurrent challenges create a seemingly impossible situation.”",
  "prediction": "2025 presents journalism with its Kobayashi Maru moment — an impossible scenario created by two converging forces. First, the 2024 U.S. election exposed how traditional media has lost its position as the primary information source for many Americans. While mainstream news invested heavily in conventional election coverage, audiences turned to alternative sources — from subject-matter-expert podcasts to community-driven platforms — for their election information. Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of AI has fundamentally altered how people expect to receive and process information. Companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic are delivering personalized, problem-solving experiences that make traditional journalism’s one-size-fits-all approach feel obsolete. These concurrent challenges create a seemingly impossible situation: News organizations must simultaneously rebuild trust and authority while completely reimagining how they serve and engage their audiences. The situation resembles Star Trek’s infamous &lt; Kobayashi Maru scenario  — a training exercise where conventional solutions prove inadequate and success requires fundamentally reimagining the rules of engagement. This metaphor perfectly captures the news industry’s current predicament — an industry facing multiple existential threats where traditional approaches appear increasingly futile, yet the stakes for democracy and public discourse remain critically high. Traditional industries offer instructive examples of successful transformation in the face of disruption. For example, Delta Airlines has evolved beyond its origins as a traditional carrier to become a sophisticated loyalty company that happens to fly planes, generating $6 billion in revenue in 2023 from credit card partnerships alone. In the news and information space, we’re seeing similar transformations from outside the industry players. For example, independent content creators like  Aaron Parnas  are explaining the news of the day and achieving remarkable reach. Parnas, a lawyer and an activist, has built an audience of 1.1 million followers on TikTok — nearly matching The New York Times’ 1.3 million followers on the platform — by positioning himself as a direct, accessible news source. This demonstrates how people who are passionate about news can successfully reimagine how to use news to inform the public and engage their audience. The compound challenge of eroding audience relevance and AI disruption requires a foundational transformation for the news industry. In the words of Jeff Bezos, “In today’s era of volatility, there is no other way but to re-invent. The only sustainable advantage you can have over others is agility, that’s it. Because nothing else is sustainable, everything else you create, somebody else will replicate.” The barriers to change for the news industry are: However, some news organizations are finding innovative ways past these barriers.  The San Francisco Standard , a for-profit digital startup, is experimenting with its membership structure to function more like a social club, offering not just traditional journalism events but also gym memberships and food tastings through partnerships with local businesses that seek community engagement beyond traditional advertising. Meanwhile,  Initium Media  has transformed its approach to serving the Chinese-speaking diaspora by rebuilding its entire editorial and product strategy around community needs. During the U.S. election, Initium demonstrated how news organizations can bridge cultural and linguistic gaps, delivering timely analysis and explanatory coverage that helped their audience navigate between their homeland and adopted society. Both organizations show how rethinking traditional news products and audience relationships can create more sustainable models for journalism. At Hacks/Hackers, we’re demonstrating how reimagining journalism’s relationship with technology and audience can be fun and innovative. Rather than pursuing superficial applications like AI-generated summaries or yet another newsletter format, participants at our events envision transformative solutions that address fundamental challenges in modern information needs. Here are some of the ideas that emerged from our  Poynter ,  ONA ,  Baltimore , and  UC Berkeley  events. While these are just concepts emerged from scenario planning exercises, they illustrate the kind of bold thinking required to move the news industry forward. This is the level of ambition and innovation that will be required to ensure journalism’s continued relevance and sustainability in the digital age. The path forward requires us to: The choice facing the news industry isn’t whether to change, but whether to proactively reimagine their role. Those news organizations that thrive will be those that recognize this moment as an opportunity to build something new — something that combines journalism’s core values with feedback from your audience and AI’s capability to deliver personalized, problem-solving experiences at scale. This transformation isn’t just about survival — it’s about fulfilling journalism’s essential role in democracy. As the 2024 election showed us, we can either evolve to meet our communities’ changing information needs, or watch as those communities find alternatives that do.

  "author": "Sam Cholke",
  "headline": "News faces its final unbundling",
  "summary": "“Every item that could be stripped out because it contained enough value to stand on its own was, sometimes by the very news organizations themselves.”",
  "prediction": "The coming year will reveal the final phase in the long unbundling of the news industry. The industry will have to confront the growing class of podcasters, influencers, and Substackers, combined with the waning reach on social media, that has separated those that build knowledge through reporting from the voices that help make sense of the news and the spaces where people discuss the news. The coming stage of news’ unbundling will require navigating new types of relationships if an investigation or accountability story is to make it into the public dialogue. It’s a new era and one primed for nonprofit news, with its longstanding values of collaboration and free distribution of content. News was once a great behemoth of a physical thing, in some places containing minimal reporting but with lots of advertising, stock quotes, coupons, weather reports, classified listings, and recipes as well analysis of and opinions about the stories covered by the newsroom. Over time, every item that could be stripped out because it contained enough value to stand on its own was, sometimes by the very news organizations themselves. Cars.com, Careerbuilder, and other real estate and classified sites were all originally created by news organizations before being sold off. Then pieces of the profession itself got unbundled. The INN Network was formed originally as the Investigative News Network from the many nonprofit startups that were founded when investigative news teams were eliminated by legacy newspaper chains. A new phase of this unbundling is happening now, perhaps best signaled by  the access provided to non-journalists  by the presidential campaigns. A new class of influencers, podcasters, and YouTubers have risen in power in shaping the public’s understanding of the news despite doing very little direct reporting.  Research  by Pew now suggests they are the dominant force in how news is consumed on social media, to the  near-complete exclusion of institutional voices  on some platforms like TikTok. This is an unbundling the news industry failed to fully prepare for. The institutions creating knowledge through reporting are now increasingly separate from the voices helping people understand what that knowledge explains about their lives and communities. This unbundling may be the most serious threat yet to news institutions vying for public support to survive. Research from the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and others has repeatedly indicated that the value of news to an individual comes primarily from its ability to  cultivate understanding  and  connection with others  more than solitary contemplation on a new bit of knowledge. The social platforms, which have increasingly  locked out publishers , have created ideal conditions to strip away the understanding and connection people can find through the news. On social media, people can see which accounts their friends follow, which posts their friends liked. In a world that provides access to endless information, it feels more important than ever to know what other people are actually reading and talking about.  The front page of the newspaper once helped news meet these needs, but the news has struggled in the digital era to not only define what’s most important to understand but also convey what information is common knowledge. All while social media makes it public knowledge that an event like  Donald Trump’s appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast  was viewed 53 million times on YouTube. Podcasters aren’t tied to the norms of a journalistic institution and are able to fully lean into the parasocial relationships audio is able to cultivate, too. They can speak about the news in relatable ways that make people feel like they’re talking about the news as they might with friends. The current economics of Substack, YouTube, and other platforms have created financial incentives for journalists that are good at that sense-making work to leave institutions for greener fields, such as Oliver Darcy and Chris Cillizza’s departures from CNN or Taylor Lorenz’s from The Washington Post. News institutions are increasingly stripped of the talent needed to combat this trend. This new unbundling of news cuts to something foundational about what journalism can do in society. Over the next year, news organizations will have to think much more creatively about collaboration and how to distribute and start conversations about their stories, areas where nonprofit news organizations are leading. They will also need to think much more deeply about not just the value they provide to society, but what value they provide to individuals beyond knowledge and how they can maintain a meaningful role in building understanding and connection.

  "prediction": "The last Trump presidency catalyzed a movement around the importance of journalism. Billionaire-led newspapers crafted bold, public-facing mission statements like “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Budgets soared. So did pageviews. When I told people what I did for a living at a party, I’d get a nod and a “So important.” And journalism organizations, for the most part, rose to the challenge. The four Trump years were chaotic, and full of so much great public-interest journalism. Then Trump lost, and that movement slowly eroded. The threat to democracy seemed to vanish. Nonprofit and for-profit news organizations experienced wave after wave of layoffs. And when Trump returned, there wasn’t much of a movement left. Yes, there was excellent journalism done. But the billionaires who lead those newspapers didn’t dream up any big, defiant slogans. Instead, they spiked endorsements of Trump’s opponent and made journalists the problem. Trump encouraged violence against journalists and threatened to use the full force of the government against us. He won the popular vote. Things are about to get worse. There will be no second Trump Bump. Some potential donors will be scared of retribution. Some won’t be happy with their investment. Some will just be tired. Some will instead send their money to things like Trump’s inauguration party. The courts will start to erode the protections we’ve long enjoyed, like  New York Times v. Sullivan . The Justice Department will target journalists for doing their job. We’ll face escalating harassment and bullying. The government will build a propaganda machine. Media businesses will get threatened by regulators for unfavorable coverage. More media owners will mimic Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong. We simply won’t have the same movement and money behind us. That will start us on a generational path toward completely rebuilding journalism from the bottom up. Not just the business model, which we’ve been tinkering with over the last two decades, but the entire model. We will become more centered in our communities. We’ll understand, reflect, and represent them better. We’ll truly serve them and begin to rebuild trust. We will triple down on accountability journalism. We will continue to detail the consequences of Trump’s actions, yes. And with the same fervor, we’ll examine the ways our leaders on all levels and all parties are failing to fix our many problems and forgetting to represent the people they’re supposed to serve. We’ll deliver our communities the information in the ways they need and want it, not in the way we always have. It’s a rebirth that will take decades to realize. It will be painful and scary. But it starts this year. Andrew Donohue  is investigative editor at  CalMatters . "

  "summary": "“The internet itself is now flooded with careless content, AI-generated or otherwise, and the effort to sift through it doesn’t pay off like it used to.”",
  "prediction": "Over the past decade (often in this annual roundup!), we’ve heard a lot about journalist-influencers and journalists who go independent through services like Patreon and Substack. But we seldom hear about the people reading these independent newsletters or listening to these podcasts or viewing journalistic social media content. My prediction is that many of these followers are going to switch up their media habits in 2025. Let’s give it a name, even if it hasn’t happened yet (and hopefully won’t): The Great Unfollowing. It will happen across the board. Podcasts will see the number of people donating through Patreon have dropped, subscriber numbers on paid services will fall. Maybe you’ll maintain the same number of followers on social media but it will be hard to tell how many in that number are actual humans paying attention to you and your posts. It could be the content has gone stale or repetitive, but if there’s a mass unfollowing, I don’t necessarily think it will have anything to do with quality. The reason I think it will happen is that the internet itself is now flooded with careless content, AI-generated or otherwise, and the effort to sift through it doesn’t pay off like it used to, for readers and listeners. Where will the followers go? Good question. There are a lot of things a person can do other than read posts on social media, listen to podcasts, or read someone’s Substack. My guess it will be a Big New Digital Thing, but I’m not sure what that thing will be. Running an independent newsletter or a podcast is often the fallback of many fallback plans for journalists. Where will these journalists go when the subscribers fall to a level that is no longer sustainable? Another good question. Joanne McNeil  is the author of  Wrong Way  and  Lurking . "

  "prediction": "It’s not enough to simply liberate big, messy datasets and hope other journalists will pick them up and run with a series of investigations. But help is here, and more is on the way, as an emerging model of support spreads and matures in 2025. Is it “concierge data journalism”? Is it “white-glove collaborations”? No matter what you call it, it’s a smart idea and one that solves a problem we’ve all heard of by now: How might we help small, local newsrooms produce more and better accountability journalism in their communities, even if they lack the people, the bandwidth, or the expertise in documents and data? Of course, there has been foundational work from newsrooms like ProPublica (and from my colleagues here at The Marshall Project) to put more data journalism into the hands of local reporters and newsrooms, some of this work dating back nearly a decade. But now, teams of data, FOIA, and beat topic experts are hoping to not only put datasets into the hands of local journalists, but also guide them through localizing the data and story angles, offering editing and infrastructure support as partners. My colleagues at The Marshall Project are expanding our  Investigate This! model , and similar work is coming through  Big Local News at Stanford . These teams work directly with local journalists to clean and analyze datasets, evaluate story ideas, and share assets. Further emerging in this space is work from  The Trace’s gun violence data hub , which launched as a help hotline in late 2024 with big aspirations to come to market in 2025. Three smart teams with a smart and similar mission: help support and create more data journalism from local newsrooms. For The Marshall Project and The Trace, we’re both single-subject newsrooms. This means our teams of journalists tend to be subject-matter experts on our particular beats. But the truth is criminal justice systems and incidents of gun violence happen at the local level, in towns and communities. It’s important for the journalists in those places to be able to tell these in-depth and crucial stories, even if they aren’t deep-dive experts — yet. Big Local News works to put datasets in the hands of journalists, but also creates webinars to onboard folks into a story angle or subject area. P. Kim Bui, a project manager with BLN, said the coaching aspect of their work is one of the most important pieces of the model. The team at BLN is largely made up of expert data journalists who invest their time in helping the smaller newsrooms navigate and execute on data stories. All three groups aim to find or obtain datasets, help clean them, then work with local journalists to specialize the topics to their own communities — building on the existing local expertise to strengthen each investigation. It’s not enough to just drop something into the laps of local teams and hope they’ll use it exactly as-is, my colleague Michelle Billman told me. And she would know: In a past life, she ran a local public media newsroom, just like the ones she’s trying to partner with now. But teams like hers and BLN’s (and soon, The Trace) are working to help journalists in small shops not just by sharing the data, but also by offering things like specialized beat knowledge, illustrations, and data demonstrations. And it’s that real-time, individual level of support that The Trace hopes to provide, in addition to access to datasets in the future. For now, their help desk is open and journalists in need of support can file tickets to the team. The hotline exists so that “any journalist can reach out and ask questions about gun violence coverage,” George LeVines, editor of the data hub, told me. Although The Trace will start making datasets available in the spring, LeVines told me his team is currently working through a number of collaborations with other newsrooms, offering support like data analysis. “I am hoping that this product can serve as a model that more broadly can be applied to data and investigative journalism overall,” he said.

  "prediction": "I predict that, over the next few years, funders will increasingly prioritize equity over inclusion when considering support for BIPOC-led media organizations. Inclusion often means adding BIPOC voices to the conversation, but equity requires a deeper commitment — one that reallocates resources, addresses historical disparities, and ensures that BIPOC-led media have the capacity to thrive and lead the future of journalism. As a Roma woman, I’ve seen firsthand the harmful narratives perpetuated by legacy media about my people. This history of media harm is why I founded  La Converse  — a BIPOC-led media organization centering marginalized communities and  building bridges where others divide.  Through my connections with other BIPOC-centered media, I’ve come to realize that we all face similar challenges. The current sustainability models often miss the mark. They fail to acknowledge the systemic challenges BIPOC-led media face, and instead, they impose unrealistic expectations of self-sufficiency. In recent years, the term  sustainability  has dominated conversations among funders, media organizations, and industry leaders. Phrases like “We want to fund sustainable organizations” and “By the end of the grant, the funding should go to zero” have become increasingly common. While sustainability is essential for any successful business, it raises an important question: Who benefits from this definition of sustainability, and who is excluded by it? BIPOC-led media strive to serve our communities, but we lack the resources available to white-led counterparts. Systemic barriers — such as limited access to networks, funding opportunities, and the absence of a generational financial cushion — make self-sufficiency a distant goal. The communities we serve are often economically disadvantaged and cannot afford to fund journalism through membership models and donations. Asking marginalized people to pay for the journalism that represents them is not only unjust but also unrealistic. Instead, we should be investing in these communities, not demanding they fund journalism meant to serve them. However, the reality is that we still ask for their support, knowing it cannot mirror the models of media that serve primarily white audiences. Relying on their financial support for our sustainability is colorblind and perpetuates inequality. Additionally, building enough power to convince communities that have been disenfranchised by media to commit to media they believe represents them takes far more time and effort than it would for people who do not carry the same experiences of trauma with media. Traditional revenue models, such as memberships, may work for legacy media with affluent audiences, but they are ill-suited for organizations like ours, which serve underserved communities. Expecting us to generate significant revenue from these communities is unfair. A recent comment from a funder at a conference — that if people can afford expensive sneakers, they should be able to pay for journalism too — overlooks a crucial reality: When individuals from racialized communities buy such items, they are often navigating a society that devalues them based on appearance. These items are not just products but tools for gaining respect, credibility, and safety in environments where they may be marginalized.  Moreover, rebuilding trust with communities harmed by legacy media is slow, difficult work. It’s not just about providing news — it’s about healing the relationship between marginalized communities and media. Many individuals already face difficult choices — between paying for basic necessities like phone bills, electricity, or groceries. Asking them to fund journalism is simply unjust. This process requires time, care, and, crucially, long-term financial support. Before we can consider financial sustainability, we must first address the harm caused by legacy media. Sustainability should come after healing. We need reparations for the damage done and reconciliation to repair the divide between the media and the communities it has failed for so long. It’s not just about surviving — it’s about fixing the systems that have failed us. Our work goes beyond producing stories. We are building meaningful connections and bridging the gap between marginalized communities and the media. We’re healing communities hurt by decades of misrepresentation. This requires more than financial support; it demands time, long-term commitment, and mission-driven funding focused on repairing trust and restoring credibility. Rebuilding this bond is essential to fostering trust, which is the foundation for lasting success. It’s not just about restoring broken trust — it’s about making people feel seen, heard, and understood.  The path to sustainability isn’t just about generating revenue — it’s about repair, reconciliation, and rebuilding trust. Slapping a “sustainable” label on organizations like ours without addressing the deep inequities is insufficient. We need reparations and reconciliation to heal the damage caused by legacy media. It’s time to redefine sustainability. The future of media funding will prioritize equity over inclusion and impact over profit. Equity-based funding models are empowering BIPOC communities, and enabling their voices to thrive in the media landscape. Rather than focusing on whether a BIPOC-led outlet can generate revenue through memberships or advertising, funders will focus on impact — the social change we are creating within our communities by investing in long-term capacity building, not just short-term projects. We need mission-based funding — financial support that reflects our mission, not one that forces us to conform to commercial models that don’t work for us.  Building on equity, funders play a crucial role in reshaping the media ecosystem. The financial support they provide is vital, but it’s not enough on its own. Funders must act as true allies. This means using their privilege to open doors for BIPOC-led organizations, connecting us to influential networks and resources that have historically been out of reach. It’s not just about writing a check; it’s about leveraging their power to advocate on our behalf and help us gain access to larger funding bodies and institutional support. While philanthropy plays a crucial role, it cannot be the sole source of support for BIPOC-led media. In Canada, government funding is largely directed to legacy media, which often overlook marginalized communities. To build an equitable media ecosystem, government funding must be more inclusive, ensuring that BIPOC-led organizations like La Converse receive the support they need to thrive and repair the relationship between media and underserved communities. BIPOC-led media are not just survivors of systemic inequities — they are powerful agents of change. By supporting these organizations, funders are securing journalism’s future. In a time when media trust is eroding, misinformation is spreading, and far-right narratives are taking hold, we are rebuilding trust with communities long excluded from the media conversation.

  "headline": "Focus on the “flabby middle” of the audience funnel",
  "summary": "“Audiences need to ‘try before they buy.&#39;”",
  "prediction": "Your New Year’s resolution should be to get a fatter middle. You should widen the waistline of the audience funnel, paying more attention to the engaged middle than the fly-by traffic at top. Build a smart strategy for the full funnel by making 2025 the year of audience journey mapping. And ensure your key performance indicators (KPIs) align and drive lower-funnel engagement. While the middle of the first quarter-century of the millennium allowed news organizations to reap the rewards of the top of the funnel (Facebook firehose, R.I.P.), the past 18 months have been more of a challenge, with many news outlets struggling for scale. Facebook pivoted away from news in 2023, and in 2024, Google got busy tweaking the algorithms to sort quality from the AI slop. Yes, AI Overviews has impacted traffic (best guess, 1 to 2% for publishers with a dedicated search strategy), but Google’s algorithm shifts have been the bigger story of the past year. But search behaviors have been changing for some time. While the U.S. Department of Justice is looking at Google’s dominance in search, Google has been slowly losing search share for years. In an ethnographic study, the  Next Gen News Report  noted the “sophisticated searching” of younger audiences. Indeed,  40% of searches  in the beauty space start on social, not Google, and  Amazon overtook Google search  for product searches years ago. This past year has seen the rise of Perplexity, Gemini, and ChatGPT Search, all of which aim to provide complete answers rather than requiring people to click. But news SEOs, don’t panic: Google Search will continue to drive audiences to news sites for a long time yet. It favors the helpful, original, and trusted (goodbye and good riddance,  parasite SEO ), and audience behaviors are slow to change. And while search has been a bumpy ride for many, Google has increased the flow of Google Discover — presumably to please audiences rather than to placate publishers. Meanwhile, social teams spent 2024 engaging off-platform, while also squeezing the last of the juice from Facebook, and creating new pathways from Bluesky, Threads, Instagram channels, and WhatsApp. An audience funnel was once an inverted triangle. It’s now an inverted trapezoid. But a top-of-funnel strategy is no longer enough. To drive value to consumers and the revenue that follows (both commercial or consumer), audience teams must focus on engagement. This is the step where we hook, where we drive habituation. Audiences need to “try before they buy,” and this is a really fun step of the audience role. It’s when we work on a newsletter that becomes a daily reading habit; it’s when we work across teams to delight audiences with familiar and distinctive voices; it’s when we try new formats, such as narrated audio, podcasts, and quizzes. We also have effective ways to get to know our audiences; offer them the right value exchange and people will create an account and login. And once we know our audience, we can better serve them and welcome them as members and subscribers. To borrow from the marketing language, we can find ways to “ surprise and delight ,” offering subscriber exclusives in both content and site and app experiences. To help you plan your audience funnel strategy, I recommend mapping your audience journey. Reading about  mapping an audience journey  on American Press Institute earlier this year, I had an “aha moment.” This framework was created by author Kamila Jambulatova, influenced by her time as a marketeer (I liked the concept so much that I reached out to Kamila and we chatted). At Condé Nast, we’ve been working cross-functionally to do just that: to map our audience journeys so that we can better serve people at each stage. As I procrastinated knowing I had to write the words to go with the funnel concept and visual, I hopped over to social where I found an “ angry ” Isabelle Roughol and a “ triggered ” Adam Tinworth, who were both lamenting the lack of “people” and “engagement” within audience strategies. As Adam helpfully summarized: “Audience engagement is the skill of taking a reader, and making them more than a subscriber. It’s the art of making an engaged member, and keeping them. And doing it again, and again, and again. Because, without them, we don’t have a business.” Sarah Marshall  is vice president for audience strategy at Condé Nast. "

  "prediction": "About the last thing anyone wants to remember from this most recent election is that the Google search “did joe biden drop out”  spiked on Election Day . Not good for the people who believe in an informed electorate being vital to democracy. I think it’s time we start looking at this a little closer, with a lot less ego and a lot more effort. The very basic assumptions we use to make journalism are breaking down. Like the very idea that people want to be informed. And that they way we inform them works for most people. Because it’s clear it does not. And they don’t. My prediction for 2025? Maybe, just maybe, we’ll put everything on the table. And I mean everything. Like how we write and who we write for. Like what we write about. Like the very assumption that people can even read our stuff. Gallup in 2022  found  that  half  of Americans aged 16 to 74 had low literacy skills. Most people read at an eighth-grade level. Billions of words (it feels like) have been spilled dissecting why news organizations are in the state they’re in. (Radio! Television! Cable! Corporate ownership! The internet! Craigslist! Google! Facebook! TikTok!) Meanwhile, 130 million people struggle to read stories written by people who either went to grad school or have thought about it far more than people who read at the eighth-grade level. If journalism is going to live up to its lofty billing as being essential to an informed democracy, it has to stop thinking that anything is above replacement. Start with the story as the atomic unit of measure. Oooh, we love to write 800-1,000 words about drama in some legislative hearing. But who are we writing that for? Does a working person just trying to get by need that? The answer is…maybe. But maybe they don’t need 1,000 words. Maybe they need something else. What about a product that uses AI to create two other versions of that story in addition to the one the human writes? That human version is the full version — all the nuance and drama and detail a highly educated reader who cares about the subject could want from a highly-educated reporter with a fancy college degree. The AI takes that and creates two more versions. The first version? For the reader who says “I barely care or have limited understanding, so give me a couple of sentences written at the eighth-grade level.” The second version? “I’m curious, but just curious, so give me a half-dozen sentences and maybe I’ll read the rest and maybe I won’t.” The reporter gives them a good working over, as does an editor, and boom: Three levels of story. Let the reader decide what they want or need now. I’m fascinated with how the writer’s ego would react to 85 percent of people reading the really short version. How many capital-W Writers will be happy when the analytics say no more than 15 percent read the long version. But what’s the point of the exercise here? Is it to inform people, or to show off what we know and how sophisticated we sound? Can journalism find a way to be happy if people are measurably more informed, even if it’s only a couple of sentences more informed? Is there joy in the aggregate? Next, can this be the year we try focusing ruthlessly on what people need instead of a term paper’s worth of sources talking about What This Means? For example, our Average Person doesn’t need the 1,000 words of drama from the planning and zoning commission, but they do need help with their bank account. Everything is expensive. People need to know how to save a buck or two. They don’t need an economist from Moody’s to tell them about inverted yield curves or the consensus opinion of what the Fed will do next. Remember: There are 130 million people who probably have no clue who or what the Fed is. Where are the news products that are laser focused on this basic idea? We used to joke, in the way that honest people confront things they don’t want admit, that most people got the newspaper for the coupons. The world has moved on from clipping coupons, but isn’t the diss-the-rubes joke among the terminally online that people voted for cheaper eggs? Where is the Wirecutter, but for groceries in my town? You give me a product where I give you my grocery list and you tell me to get these things at Hy-Vee, these at Super Saver and these at Trader Joe’s and I’ll save $15 even after factoring in the gas to drive there and I’ll gladly pay the monthly subscription. You’ll make loyal subscribers with a big number at the top that says “Your $20 subscription has saved you $90 this month.” If this sounds like those early-2000s sticky notes on the front of the Sunday newspaper saying there’s $159 in coupons inside, it should! People paid money for news because of that sticky note. Rub some modern tech on it, make it ruthlessly local, and I bet you they’ll do it again.

  "headline": "Ethical state funding for the press",
  "summary": "“To ensure state funding includes effective safeguards, several countries have developed schemes that could serve as potential best practices.”",
  "prediction": "The business model for the news media industry in the digital era remains uncertain. But a liberal democracy cannot function properly without an independent and free press. State funding, an increasing trend across the European Union, offers a potential solution to this challenge. According to the 2024 study  Public financing of news media in the EU , there is a clear shift in Europe toward state budget funding and diverse support mechanisms for private media, primarily targeting newspapers. This trend is driven by several factors, including the financial challenges faced by traditional media due to declining revenues and the need to promote media pluralism to safeguard democracy, as well as urgency to support regional and local journalism, which is vital for community engagement. Additionally, public funding assists media outlets in adapting to digital transformation and ensuring citizens’ access to reliable, high-quality information essential for an informed public debate. Despite the potential benefits of state funding, there are clear risks. The most obvious is the risk to independence and editorial freedom. Direct financial support from the state can lead to real or perceived government influence over media content, potentially compromising journalistic independence. Certain countries, such as Spain or Italy, face higher risks concerning media independence and editorial freedom. As the report states, concerns about the independence of private news media sectors are mostly related to politicians exercising their influence on private news companies, interference with editorial decisions, and the content of independent editorial boards. The perception that news media independence is under pressure is frequently expressed in southern Europe. This is due to the characteristics of the Mediterranean journalism system, where there is no clear division between opinion and information, and where the news media tends to align with the political sphere. This leads to a general sentiment of distrust. In countries like Spain and Italy, only 13% of the population thinks that the news media is free from undue political influence, compared to 50% in Finland. To ensure state funding includes effective safeguards, several countries have developed schemes that could serve as potential best practices. Countries like France, which gives direct aid to newspapers, have explored various ways to enhance fairness. It’s crucial to implement transparent criteria for subsidy allocation, ensuring that funds are distributed equitably across different types of media outlets. Regular assessments and adjustments of the subsidy mechanisms can help address any disparities and better support media pluralism and independence. Other countries, like Denmark, offer production grants to news media based on editorial content volume, supporting both print and digital publications. This system promotes media plurality by providing financial assistance irrespective of the distribution platform. In Sweden, the state provides operational support to daily newspapers facing significant competition, ensuring that multiple news sources remain available to the public. This policy helps maintain a diverse media landscape and prevents market monopolization. Finally, in Belgium, the government offers project-based support focusing on journalism innovation and the development of new business models. This encourages media outlets to adapt to the digital age and explore sustainable revenue streams. All these examples show some promise, but the devil is always in the details. 2025 will be the year to follow closely the actual impact of all these measures on the news media, its sustainability and, mostly, its actual independence and freedom.

  "headline": "Why 2025 is all about user needs",
  "summary": "“Audience engagement has been narrowly tackled by our industry for far too long, often treated as a side initiative rather than a central purpose of journalism.”",
  "prediction": "In 2025, I challenge you to send me a news user need I have yet to come across. A year ago, I  predicted  the spread of user needs models in global publishing, and I stand vindicated. Across continents, newsrooms have been enthusiastically adopting their own models, leveraging AI tools to conduct relevant analysis, develop specific needs-based coverage further, and create actionable editorial insights. These advances are changing storytelling and commissioning decisions based on audience data. In fact, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism dedicated an entire chapter of its 2024 annual report on digital journalism to  the user needs framework . The four key axes of news consumption are quite clear: audiences mainly want to (a) know, (b) understand, (c) feel, and (d) do something in connection to the news. Consequently, commissioning logic evolves. Instead of one lengthy feature that might dilute various aspects and angles during editing, consider producing three shorter, more structured pieces. For instance, a “Give me perspective” story to kick off the coverage, followed by an “Inspire me” piece about the main character, and concluding with a “Help me” or “Connect me” story, ensuring your audience feels personally assisted. Here’s why the user needs model is so central to your newsroom’s raison d’être. It transcends mere output optimization. Audience engagement has been narrowly tackled by our industry for far too long, often treated as a side initiative rather than a central purpose of journalism. Serious investments were made, but the approach remained limited. Let me tell you why. Audience engagement is not just about cultivating your audiences, optimizing distribution, or leveraging platforms. It must be at the core of everything you do, beginning with your editorial strategy. Ultimately, you create content to engage your audience — that’s the primary goal.  This perspective isn’t unique to me. The user needs approach underscores this perfectly: satisfying user needs effectively starts with creating the right content from the outset. You must continually ask: “What’s the real reason for doing this?” I advocate for treating audience engagement as a pan-newsroom activity. One of my first recommendations to some of my Ringier Media International newsrooms was to rename the audience development team titles from “managers” to “editors.” Words matter. This change emphasizes the integration rather than separation of roles. How often have we heard, “the editorial team and the social media team” or “the audience engagement team and the editorial team”? I’ll say it again, words matter. When we separate these functions linguistically, a disconnect ensues. Somehow tactics — albeit smart ones — overtook the strategy in our sector. My mantra “What will happen to your audience’s lives if your media were to disappear tomorrow?” remains relevant. If your content doesn’t positively impact your audience’s lives, making you indispensable (thank you, The Athletic, for your stellar Chelsea FC coverage!), there’s no hope, AI tools or not. And while we are on a sports topic, the “Make me feel nostalgic” need is very relevant for sports and entertainment output, a subset of a Feel axis. It’s wonderful to have specific brand needs like “Help me discover new ideas,” “Orient me,” “Help me relate,” “Bring clarity,” “Enrich my life,” “Motivate me,” “Show me the impact.” And it doesn’t matter if you call them user needs or user modes or user motivations. They all, however, align with the fundamental “know-understand-feel-do” model. The real question is: Why do your newsrooms still believe they can adequately engage your audience without meeting these foundational news needs? And why do we insist on treating audience engagement so narrowly by design? I’ll end with a challenge: If you believe a news user need you’ve identified doesn’t fit into the “know-understand-feel-do” model, let’s discuss. Typically, I can refute such notions within minutes, but who knows, right? Dmitry Shishkin  is CEO of  Ringier Media International . "

  "link": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/12/should-we-predict-or-define/",
  "author": "Thomas Baekdal",
  "headline": "Should we predict or define?",
  "summary": "“Any time you hear about publishers using AI to produce journalism as if it’s factory output, that’s when you know they’ll have a bad year ahead.”",
  "prediction": "When it comes to looking at the year ahead, we can approach it in two ways: We can either predict what we think will happen, based on the trends, or we can define what outcome we want to achieve. I’m going to do both, because they’re not the same. Let’s talk predictions first. There are many things that, based on what we already see, seem likely to happen in 2025. First, the declining level of traffic from social media will likely continue to decline. Also, the focus many publishers have started to put on TikTok is unlikely to lead to any real monetary improvement — nor is it likely to change the problem of getting young people to subscribe. Similarly, channels like Threads or Bluesky will grow, but not at the scale we used to think about social media. As such, they are more or less irrelevant when it comes to the actual profitability of publishers. This isn’t just because of changes to those channels, but more because of how the public has changed. The public simply doesn’t use social media the way they used to, and news, in particular, is a really bad fit for that changed behavior. Google Search is also likely to continue the declines we’re already seeing, with the total volume of search traffic going down. Add to that the introduction of AI into search, which will have a polarizing effect on who gets the traffic. In other words, fewer sites will get a larger share of the total traffic, leading to the problem of “the rich getting richer.” So, if you’re a smaller publisher, search is becoming a real problem. It’s simple math. With old search, you’d get a full page of search results. Obviously, the top results would get more of the traffic, but you would still see traffic from results further down the list. With AI, people get one answer, so all the attention is now focused on just that one source. Another issue with search is how Google has changed its algorithm to only rank publishers based on their primary focus. This is a significant change, because it means you’ll only rank high with articles that Google considers to be your primary focus, while everything else you do will be down-ranked. From a user perspective, this is great, because the highest-ranked sites are also those with that expertise. But for newspapers, this is a disaster because all those other things you do — like entertainment, car reviews, etc. — will no longer be boosted by the ranking of your political reporting. Speaking of AI, 2025 will obviously be filled with it. In fact, it”ll likely be overflowing with it. This, however, will take us in two opposing directions. One direction is how AI is transforming the way we work, the way we define journalism, and how we interact and create relevance for our audiences. In 2025, we’ll see a lot of interesting efforts in this area. It will take much more than a year to figure it all out (more like 10 or 15), but 2025 will be another year of AI experiments. But in the other direction are all the AI missteps. These occur when publishers start using AI in ways that undermine their value. In 2024, we saw a ton of that. Publishers started using AI to produce articles that nobody should ever read, because they were very poor quality and had nothing to do with real journalism. We’ve seen companies turning to AI voices, which made their audio sound generic and disconnected. And it’s not about the quality of the voices — it’s the purpose of it. In 2025, we’re going to see many, many more such missteps, and it will likely ruin several publishers, because they’ll only realize the damage they are causing to themselves too late. Basically, any time you hear about publishers using AI to produce journalism as if it’s factory output, that’s when you know they’ll have a bad year ahead. The next trend is audience, and many of the arrows are pointing in the wrong direction. Trust is declining; news fatigue, avoidance, and burnout are rising, and polarization is getting worse, etc. On top of this, we have another Trump presidency, which will cause another Trump bump — although at considerably lower levels than previously — but will also further worsen all the trends I just mentioned. What’s important to remember, though, is that people need news. It’s just that we aren’t doing it in a way that actually drives relevance. This leads us to the second question: What should we focus on in 2025? Simply put, we need to focus on changing the way we interact with our audiences to reverse the trends. And doing this is actually quite easy. The U.S. is kind of weird because the way the public interacts politically is almost the opposite of how people interact non-politically. Take something like climate change. Politically, it’s a topic that is tearing people apart. But as soon as people realize how much money they can save, suddenly it no longer matters what the politicians are saying. It’s the same with companies. Right now, every corporate executive knows that in order to stay competitive, they need to focus on the next generation of products, many of which need to be sustainability-focused to be competitive. Because if they don’t, China is going to roll right over them. China is fast becoming the world leader in the next generation of climate-focused products, whether that’s cars, consumer goods, or industrial equipment. So every executive knows that they need to innovate as well. It doesn’t matter what the political situation is like, nor what political party people prefer. This disconnect, especially in the U.S., has a huge influence on the trend above, and it explains why we in the press face the problems that we do. But we can fix this by focusing on what people actually need, rather than on what they are politically obsessed with. A perfect example of this is what happened to The Washington Post when they announced that they didn’t want to endorse a presidential candidate. Immediately, it lost 250,000 subscribers. It’s important to understand that this only happened because their focus was so heavily skewed towards the political drama, as opposed to being focused on what would actually be relevant, useful, and valuable to people in their day-to-day lives. In 2025, we’re going to see a lot more of this. But the publishers who will come out ahead are those who understand that this is an unhealthy focus that undermines the value of their journalism, and instead shift their attention to what people need from them outside of their political obsessions. So this is the most important focus for the year ahead. Thomas Baekdal  is a media analyst and founder of  Baekdal . "

But the dominant, mainstream industry — the major print and web publications, television and cable outlets, national radio — utterly, utterly failed to convey the information that we needed to prevent a fascist movement from gaining power in the United States. What greater failure could there be for journalism?  Far too many in this country were uninformed, misinformed, or simply lied to about the topics that journalism is meant to communicate clearly, truthfully, and widely. Will it do better in 2025? I fear it’s too late for that conversation. More realistic may be: How will it survive at all in 2025?

  "prediction": "In 2025, journalism is going to get a much-needed reality check. Instead of sticking to old habits and assuming people will adapt to how we deliver news, we’ll finally start designing content that fits into real lives — short attention spans and busy schedules. The focus will shift to meeting people where they are, offering news that’s not just informative but genuinely useful, relatable, and easy to engage with. For too long, newsrooms have created content based on their own routines, preferences, and platforms, churning out long stories or endless updates without really thinking about what the audience wants — or can keep up with. But with so much information (and misinformation) flying around, it’s clear the traditional approach isn’t cutting it. People are overwhelmed, exhausted, and, in many cases, just tuning out. And the new industry’s success metrics are too often based on getting people to do more of something that makes them feel bad. In response, journalism will become more realistic about how people consume news. Instead of bombarding audiences with constant breaking news or lengthy investigations that demand uninterrupted time, we’ll see more news products like concise end-of-day recaps that give a clear sense of what’s important, stories broken into smaller, more digestible formats like explainers or visuals, FAQs that answer questions people have, and content that reflects what’s happening in their neighborhoods. Relatability will also be a focus. Content that helps people navigate their lives, solve problems, or take action will be prioritized. From guides on accessing local resources to practical advice on everything from climate adaptation to mental health, journalism will lean harder into being helpful. This is how newsrooms will build trust and prove their value. This won’t be an easy shift. The reality is, most people don’t have time to read every story or keep up with every update — and more and more are choosing not to. Instead of expecting them to change, we’ll adapt to what works for them, even if it means showing unusual humility and being willing to shift our own priorities and expectations. By focusing on creating news that’s useful, relatable, and tailored to real attention spans, journalism can reclaim its role in people’s lives. In 2025, the goal won’t just be producing great stories — it’ll be making sure those stories reach people in ways that matter to them. That’s how we’ll stay relevant and rebuild trust.

  "summary": "“Ask someone in your life under 40 where they get the news. Odds are they’ll mention a non-newsroom podcaster or YouTuber.”",
  "prediction": "What would you do to get your reporting in front of an audience of hundreds of thousands? Or maybe even millions? Here’s a hint: You don’t have to get on the evening news. In 2025, let’s imagine a new type of journalist in newsrooms across the country: A content creator. Picture a modern-day news anchor who has perfected the skill of connecting with online audiences. They’re not only a news distributor, but also a bridge between the newsroom and the public. They use charisma, journalistic chops, and digital fluency to break down complex topics in understandable and relatable ways for the vast audience on social media. They build a loyal following. Maybe that TikTok video or X post featuring your reporting reaches the exact communities it’s supposed to serve. For years, research has shown that news consumers are becoming increasingly interested in getting news from social media rather than on-platform. And on video-based platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, audiences are  paying attention  to ordinary people and influencers more than trained journalists. Most of these news influencers are  not affiliated  with or trained by a news organization. And  a recent UNESCO study  showed that a majority of influencers fail to verify the information that they’re sharing with their audiences. What a huge opportunity for journalists. As many news organizations use the same old social playbook and struggle to drive traffic, creators thrive — breaking through the noise, building a loyal audience and driving engagement. Some newsrooms, like The Washington Post and Morning Brew, are already running successful creator-led initiatives. And many others already have talented, dedicated social media editors. But too often, they spend their days scrambling to get posts up on X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and more. It’s hard to find the time and resources necessary to craft a compelling social video. In 2025, I hope newsrooms will prioritize social media as a core component of how news is distributed, consumed, and understood and invest in a content creator. This person could easily become as synonymous with a news brand as an anchor is with a TV station. With that should come a competitive contract — people who are the face of a news organization deserve pay and benefits that match the level of responsibility. Ask someone in your life under 40 where they get the news. Odds are they’ll mention a non-newsroom podcaster or YouTuber. Now imagine that influencer is in your newsroom already — a trained, charismatic journalist who has built a strong, engaged following on social media. You bring them a story. Together, you co-create, collaborating to determine the best way to bring your reporting to life on social video. Maybe it’s breaking your story down, or maybe it’s a complementary video that shows how you gathered or verified your reporting. Then they share it across multiple platforms, where they’ve amassed sizable followings. And once it’s live, they engage with the audience, answering questions with more of your reporting and maybe even sending you tips and sources from the comment section that help drive your follow-up story. The videos rack up hundreds of thousands of views. Maybe even millions. Julia Munslow  is a senior platform editor on the social visuals team at The Wall Street Journal. "

  "prediction": "We find ourselves in a moment that can be best described as a  negative moment . We are returning to the  sunken place , overcome with terror at what might be, still burdened by the scars from last time. We saw respectable news organizations make a political choice of “neutrality” in the face of what many saw as an end to the last vestiges of normative approaches to governance. Even the most minuscule progress made in recent years is about to be undone. Organizations claiming to be defenders of democracy watched all this unfold and chose to be bystanders. This may be a prelude to what is to come over the next few years. We saw a foreshadowing of this future when a newly elected politician  “joked”  about perhaps ignoring the Constitution to ensure he stayed for an extra term. We have seen it in the sane-washing of some nominees, with their potential rise being framed as  “magical”  or as merely bringing  “bravado and baggage”  to their potential jobs. There seems to be an agreement to pretend that what is unfolding is not unfolding and that it will be fine. The press acts like a frog in a boiling pot, while having the memory of goldfish. We are in a negative moment, and as Achille Mbembe reminds us, the result is anything but uncertain. So what does the next year look like? Honestly, it’s difficult to imagine the chaos about to appear. Between trying to redefine their role in a world of toxic podcasts and the owners of problematic social media sites, journalists may have to reimagine how they cover issues around misogyny and the dehumanization of segments of American society. They’ll have to take seriously their role as nurturers of this thing we call society. Instead of their infatuation with the latest climate-killing technology, perhaps they’ll focus on explaining and parsing the water hose of chaos about to rain on us. I don’t think they will, though, considering how the media has covered crises abroad or how they have contrived to brew tempests in teacups at home. When  promising to pardon hundreds who attempting to overthrow a legitimately elected government  is treated as functionally similar to a president  pardoning their son of charges we all know do not pass the sniff test , we have a problem. When student protests are so poorly contextualized, and police action on campuses around the country is treated as necessary, there is little hope. When even the association of Black journalists decides to platform a candidate who had shown nothing but disdain to Black people,  Black female journalists  especially, there is little hope. Perhaps even more importantly, those who own newspapers in this country are becoming more likely to meddle with editorial stances as they seek to curry favor with the powers that be. As newspaper owners and television executives seek to fence off their privileges, we’ll be left with husks of organizations that not long ago enjoyed audiences’ loyalty. It will become clear that owners and executives have grown less concerned with “ all the news that’s fit to print ,” or with  democracy dying in darkness , or the need “ to inform, engage, and empower .” So next year, media owners and CEOs will hamper any attempts by their organizations to hold power accountable. To be clear, many within these organizations have already shown a willingness to hold back in favor of access to political elites — so these actions by owners and CEOs will be more of an alignment of goals than a top-down push. We seem to be on the precipice of trouble, and there’s no one to help us. J. Siguru Wahutu  is an assistant professor of media, culture, and communication at NYU. "

  "headline": "Right-wing studies’ time has come",
  "summary": "“Factual accuracy is a necessary but insufficient goal of professional journalism. Journalists need to compile facts into a vision of reality that is more compelling than that offered by right-wing media and by Donald Trump.”",
  "prediction": "When Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, there was a collective sense of shock — I don’t think even he expected to win. This time, it’s giving resignation and despair — or triumphalism depending on your political persuasion. The last time this happened, scholars and journalists sought to explain what then seemed inexplicable.  Pizzagate  and a proliferation of false information online, circulated  in part by Russian bots , felt new. Trump’s penchant for conspiracism, his blatant disregard for fact-based reasoning, felt especially threatening to professions nominally devoted to documenting empirical reality. Oxford Dictionaries named “post-truth” its  word of the year . By focusing on misinformation and disinformation, journalists and scholars found a  seemingly apolitical and nonpartisan  solution to a fundamentally political problem.  Foundations and social media companies  — not to mention news outlets that remained stubbornly committed to old fashioned objectivity norms — loved this framing. It allowed journalists and academics, in particular, to “do something” about the media conditions thought to have given rise to Trumpism, while remaining steadfast in their long-held commitments to political impartiality. Large sums of money flooded into the academy, funding new centers and studies of media effects and media literacy. News outlets created new beats — devoting resources to fact-checking and reporting on various false claims and misinformation campaigns.  “Someone is wrong on the Internet”  became news. Like the early 20th-century  propaganda analysis   it mirrored , this mis/disinformation paradigm was always based on a  false premise . It posited Trump voters as dupes — haplessly tricked by false information, by “fake news.” It positioned misinformation as a  cause  of political disagreement instead of recognizing that facts themselves — their veracity, their meaning, their political implications — have always been a  site  of political disagreement and contestation. By pretending that there is a simple, non-contested “information” against which we can measure “mis”-information, we’ve assumed common standards of judgment that do not exist. By pretending that “ facts have a liberal bias ,” we have ceded the terrain of ideological struggle to the right. While we insisted on the self-evidence of empirical reality, Trump has fine-tuned a political narrative of the world that offers a more salient (if horrific) interpretation of that reality. The time has come for a different approach. The time has come for  right-wing studies . By and large, Trump voters don’t support him because they are confused, or lacking in information. They vote for him because he aligns with their values and interests, as they understand them. Right-wing studies seeks to understand these values and interests, even and especially when they conflict with established understandings of empirical reality and their presumed political implications. Right-wing studies seeks to understand the world as understood by right-wingers — not to validate or valorize that worldview, but to gain insights helpful in shaping it toward different political ends. Journalism and press analysis rooted in right-wing studies would not be so concerned with bolstering some empiricist notion of “truth.” It would focus, instead, on documenting and understanding the social and cultural conditions that render that empiricist truth irrelevant to large swaths of the population. It would acknowledge that facts mean nothing outside of interpretation, that truth does not exist outside of persuasion. Factual accuracy is a necessary but insufficient goal of professional journalism. Journalists need to compile facts into a vision of reality that is more compelling than that offered by right-wing media and by Donald Trump. One thing the press can and should do right now toward this end: mitigate the harms of a second Trump administration by amplifying and exacerbating the contradictions internal to U.S. conservatism. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Democratic messaging sought to convey Republicans as a monolith. Project 2025 was put forth as evidence of a conservative conspiracy to fundamentally transform our country and put an end to democracy. While there is much to fear about the ideological vision advanced by Project 2025, several of its proposals are either internally contradictory or reflect real disagreements within the right over how best to wield governmental authority. As historians of the right know well, and as an emboldened and over-reaching Trump will soon find out, U.S. conservatism is a motley coalition of contradictory visions, interests, and personalities. This creates real policy and personal wedges to be exploited. Journalists should seek them out. Report on them. Make them fight each other so they can’t unite against the rest of us. If we’ve learned anything in the past eight years, it’s that journalists and academics are not on the sidelines of political conflict. Professional knowledge creators are, wittingly or not, engaged in political work. The right has long understood that reality is socially, culturally, and politically constructed. It’s time we act accordingly ourselves. A.J. Bauer  is an assistant professor in the Department of Journalism and Creative Media at the University of Alabama. "

  "summary": "“We can continue to complain about this new generation of content creators and how those in power use them to amplify their messages of hate — or we can adapt and fight for truth, freedom of expression, and democracy.”",
  "prediction": "The recent U.S. presidential election made it even clearer (if anyone needed proof) that podcasters, YouTubers, and content creators are closer to the audience than traditional media and journalists, and their opinions mobilize more people. This has been happening for years, but in many sectors of journalism (at least in Latin America) we’ve refused to accept this reality. It’s been easier to dismiss them — to say that they are a passing fad, or that the public will eventually realize that what they are doing is not journalism. That is not and will not be the reality. Undoubtedly, many of them lack the informational cleanliness, data validation and sense of (supposed) neutrality that we journalists have, but they have a greater connection to the audience and have managed to create loyal communities. It is time to accept this and learn from their way of telling stories on the right platforms — the closeness and interaction they have with the audience, and the power of creating loyal communities — instead of thinking that things will go back to the way they were before, where the media had control of the information. There’s a sense of journalism’s moral authority and monopoly on truth, but the reality is that legacy media continue to lose audiences and credibility around the world every year, while more people get their information from TikTok, YouTube, and WhatsApp and trust content creators more. This undoubtedly opens the door to false information, half-truths, and increased polarization as people seek only creators who confirm their ideas or political position. We must try to change this situation, but we journalists are fighting on an almost non-existent front of intellectual superiority. People don’t feel that we are close to them. This doesn’t mean that we have to abandon the fundamental values of journalism, such as verifying information, providing context, not lying, not looking for the easy clicks or views, and not being sensationalist. The battle with content creators is not lost, but it’s necessary to understand what formats and approaches to the communities they use. We need to stop looking down on them and learn how to deal with the wave of distrust and polarization that is reaching people. What’s happening today in the United States has been happening for years in Mexico, Argentina, and El Salvador, to name a few. In these countries, those in power have privileged YouTubers and content creators associated with their ideology in order to continue positioning themselves among the communities they need close to them. In Mexico, we saw this in the previous government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who favored YouTubers in his daily presidential press conferences. He preferred their easy questions to the complicated ones from the journalists of legacy media, whom he attacked throughout his administration. He also gave exclusive interviews to YouTubers and content creators and used them as spokespeople to spread false data or criticize legacy media journalists who published investigations showing corruption or failures of his government. The daily press conferences, which were broadcast on YouTube, made López Obrador the most watched streamer in Latin America in 2023 — he had 49 million hours of viewing on his channel, which has more than 4.5 million followers. The new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has followed suit. In Argentina and El Salvador, presidents Javier Milei and Nayib Bukele have created tight networks of national and international influencers and even act as content creators themselves. Both also attack traditional media journalists on a daily basis, even filing lawsuits against them. YouTubers and content creators sympathetic to their government have direct access to the presidential communications teams. It’s very easy to see how what’s happening in these countries mirrors what is happening in the United States today. The path is very clear. In journalism, we can continue to complain about this new generation of content creators and how those in power use them to amplify their messages of hate — or we can adapt and fight for truth, freedom of expression, and democracy.

  "summary": "“We need to have deep conversations about how we are doing, not just water cooler moments in the newsroom.”",
  "prediction": "It’s ironic that listening is one of the core skills in journalism and yet we spend very little time listening inward — to our own selves and to each other. Focusing on our external audience is essential to our business; however, paying attention and caring for our colleagues is just as important to our sustainability. It’s crucial to tackle the mental health epidemic affecting many media professionals worldwide. While peer support initiatives started in the media as early as 2006, they’re still a scarce resource. In 2025, they will become a common practice in our industry. This isn’t just wishful thinking: This year, we’ve already seen the conversation spread, with a guide on “ The Power of Peer Support ” published by PEN America, a half-day discussion among partners at the  ACOS Alliance  meeting in London, and multiple sessions on the topic during the  Mental Health in Journalism Summit  (MHJS24). “Journalists repeatedly tell us that they prefer to seek support from other journalists when faced with occupational stressors” said Susan E. McGregor, research scholar at Columbia’s Data Science Institute and co-author of the PEN America report, which focused on online harassment. So is a simple “Hey, how are you?” once in a while enough? Yes and no.  We need to have deep conversations about how we are doing, not just water cooler moments in the newsroom. Providing a listening ear is  more powerful than you think . Regular 1:1 meetings with managers are one of the best ways to mitigate burnout — but still are regularly overlooked due to our busy schedules. One common mistake: We tend to believe we should offer a fix, a solution. The truth is that  what most people want  is to feel seen and heard by an empathetic listener. What the journalism community currently needs for collective resilience are permanent — and not random — structures of peer support. These can show up in several ways: Unions or journalism associations can also provide this type of resource. Cross-industry programs are facilitated, for example, by the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines; the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism, which created a program as a result of the needs that emerged with the Gaza conflict; and Netzwerk Recherche, which has an anonymous  telephone counseling service  attended by peers in Germany. (Learn more by  watching  the MHJS24 session “Implementing Journalist Peer Support Programs: Lessons from Those Who Have Done It, 2006 to Now.”) Regardless of the format, the key is that most of the value comes from exchanges between peers. “Our thought provoking discussions showed me that I’m not alone with my worries and challenges. We have very similar experiences no matter which part of the world we live and work in — and this realization itself is a great help!” said Blanka Zöldi, editor-in-chief of Lakmusz (Hungary) during one of The Self-Investigation’s  programs . Active listening is at the heart of all of these options. In other words: listening deeply, non-judgmentally and empathetically is what’s essential for these structures to work. But it requires two to tango. “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth — unless you ask me how I am, in which case I will say, ‘I’m fine,’ even though I’m not fine” reads the caption of a New Yorker  cartoon  of a man taking the oath on a witness stand. Many probably identify with him — trying to hide their struggles due to fear of being looked down on or of retaliation for being considered  too weak . Any support measures, even if coming from other journalists, can fail if they’re not paired with the proper awareness actions, such as  this blog  where Reuters colleagues speak up about their experiences. We know very, very well the power of stories, of careful listening and genuine curiosity. Let’s put our expert communication skills to use in order to end mental health stigma in the media.

This year, I could predict that Bluesky will successfully emerge as the new social media platform of choice for news/media friends and junkies. (Follow me  here .) Or I could predict, rather reliably, that an AI “news” product will fail miserably and continue to reveal the tech’s inability to match the (grifter) hype. (I fully believe in the tech, just not the vendors who are selling it to uninformed leaders hungry for an easy answer to address their ongoing shortcomings.) Or that an owner of a news org will choose to appease the president-elect in order to advance their personal financial self-interest. Or, hell,  all three at once . But this year, I predict that you — yes,  you  — will stand up, speak up, and do the right thing for the communities we aim to serve, including many who either are or will be under attack by the incoming administration. I predict that you — possibly in a small conference room with just a handful of colleagues, or in a one-on-one meeting with your boss, or on a stage in front of a large audience, or most likely through an email — will realize that this is the moment you can’t stay silent and must finally speak up. Trans people are human beings. Immigrants are human beings. Palestinians are human beings. Women’s rights are human rights. A lie is a lie, not an alternative fact. Racism is racism, not “racially tinged.” Not all stories have two sides. And some that do do not have equal weighted sides. There are going to be so many of these big moments, so be prepared. Before the start of the new year, I want you to write down and remember: What are your values? What do you stand for now…before it gets any tougher? Are you willing to speak up? Are you willing to quit your job? Are you willing to put your safety on the line for those values? I don’t pretend to know where each of us will draw the line — but I believe that we each have a line that we will not cross and where we can no longer stay silent. And while many of us have the luxury of time to contemplate where our line may or may not be, many, many others do not. They have been harassed. They have been attacked. They have been killed. This is not an exercise of “what ifs” — it’s a reality of “what now.” And I have faith that you — yes, you — will stand up to meet the moment to give a full-throated answer to whatever tough question this new reality will bring you. The time has come to speak up for what you think is right. Don’t let our communities — especially the vulnerable ones that are current being attacked and dehumanized — down. Don’t let me down. More importantly, don’t let yourself down. Robert Hernandez  is a professor of professional practice of journalism at USC Annenberg. "

  "summary": "“This moment will inevitably require newsrooms, and journalists, to change. But when hasn’t that been the case?”",
  "prediction": "There are many factors that got us to where we are, but the fact of the matter is that a significant portion of the population does not want to engage with traditional news organizations. Reporters Without Borders  found  that, in a less-than-two-month span, Donald Trump insulted, attacked, or threatened the press more than 100 times — and that not counting his social media posts. The January 6 riot featured someone  writing “Murder The Media” on the Capitol doors . J.D. Vance rallies regularly saw  attendees boo members of the press  who were called on to ask questions. A 2019 Pew study  found  that the more someone approved of Trump, the more they believed the media had low ethical standards. When audiences don’t trust the most reputable newsrooms, and the incoming administration is incapable of embarrassment, it means the way we cover the highest branches of government has to change.  But I’m more concerned with what it means at the local and community levels. The way that people voted on policy in 2024 didn’t always align with party.  In Missouri , for example, liberal policy initiatives such as protecting abortion rights, raising the minimum wage to $15, and guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers were successful, all while the Republicans who campaigned against those proposals dominated by a large margin. Ballot initiatives are a way for voters to tell us how they want to shape the things that directly impact their lives. These issues, along with a host of questions that keep people up at night — how to afford the price of groceries, how to care for aging loved ones, how to apply for their preferred school district — cannot go unaddressed. People still need information, even if they aren’t attracted to consuming, and in some cases are  intentionally shutting off , what has traditionally been called news.  Information allows us to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families. There are three areas I see as opportunities: This moment will inevitably require newsrooms, and journalists, to change. But when hasn’t that been the case?

  "summary": "“Newsrooms will need to create new products in the broadening domain of what used to be called fact-checking.”",
  "prediction": "That the mission of journalism is to speak truth to power and hold power accountable doesn’t need explaining or defending — except, currently, to many of the powers in question.  It’s not news, of course, that accessible fact-based journalism is increasingly under threat. But in the past year — and even the past month, with the election of Donald Trump and its cascade of potential effects on independent news media and the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation globally — it’s becoming increasingly real and more urgent.  I think literally no newsroom will be able to consider themselves unaffected. The intensification of the official top-down and informal cyber-driven siege on journalism will accelerate the diminishing trust in news media, and the diminishing access to facts on the digital platforms where most people get their news.  I predict, and hope, that in 2025 this will become a powerful motor driving not just commissioning but the creation of new formats and beats, and maybe even new roles. To cite Nobel Prize winner Maria Ressa, without facts there is no truth, without truth there is no trust — without those, there is no more shared reality. So no matter what the nature or the size of a news media — legacy public broadcasters like my own, digital startups, local news organizations, global subscription newspapers — all of this will affect all of our audiences, and it will affect our impact and even viability.  Add to this snapshot of the current state of play two other powerful trends we’re seeing develop globally: first, the growth of generative AI in all forms, from text to images to video, turbocharging the potential production and impact of disinformation; and second, the increasingly blurred lines between traditional media and influencers with media-size followings, and also between influencers and politicians who adopt influencer tactics of persuasion and have influencer-size followings (c.f. Trump cabinet nominees Elon Musk or Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former regularly bashing the media, and the latter selling products whose claimed health benefits are contestable). Newsrooms will need to create new products in the broadening domain of what used to be called fact-checking. It is now a more urgent form of safeguarding of the facts, and in some newsrooms it may actually become a dedicated vertical or desk. We’ve already seen fact-checking, as a literal exercise, grow and diversify into now common genres like debunking, decoding and explainer formats — becoming videos, charts, newsletters, sidebars, and embeds.  Now and in the year to come, more new genres need to emerge that use new kinds of facts, like satellite imagery, open source databases, and a whole diversity of often user-generated content accessible across the social web — the same resources used to proliferate misinformation and lies. These will push newsrooms to develop new forms of narrative to produce those stories in ways that explicitly explain and clarify. These will call for new skills and the dedication of specific newsroom resources to these kinds of stories, even if in many newsrooms this may mean the difficult reallocation of resources to doing this.  Newsrooms will need to commission differently, dedicating journalists to “prebunking,” the process of identifying and debunking misconceptions, lies, or toxic sources before they rise and go viral. Many newsrooms already do this indirectly, producing formats of what we’ve been for years called explanatory journalism. This will become even more embedded in newsrooms, and increasingly viewed as just as essential and important a part of coverage as any traditional beat.  Whatever a newsroom decides to call it — fact-checking, explainers, OSINT journalism, explanatory journalism, debunking, prebunking — the deliberate and explicit advocacy for facts will eventually become part of everyone’s job.

  "prediction": "A year ago, the  International Women’s Media Foundation  was preparing to launch a  nationwide journalism initiative  that would provide in-person holistic safety training and wrap-around support to journalists and newsrooms before the U.S. elections.  My prediction then  was a call to action that, as an industry, we had an obligation to better prepare journalists due to the increasing threats to press freedom and the decline of journalism safety in the United States. We partnered with more than 20 journalism collaboratives, universities, and newsrooms, including the Reporter’s Committee for Freedom of the Press, to train more than 600 journalists in 21 cities on physical, digital, legal, and psychological safety throughout 2024. After logging thousands of miles on the road this past year, the need for this work continues. We  learned  that 36% of journalists who responded to our national survey had previously been threatened with or experienced physical violence, 33% were threatened with or experienced digital violence, and 28% reported legal threats or actions against them while working as a journalist. Every photojournalist we interviewed had experienced harm and physical threats, and we heard countless stories from journalists about how they were harassed by law enforcement — even when they identified themselves as press. Journalists have been dehumanized and treated as enemies when they are truly in service of society, shining a light on what is happening in the world around us. As we prepare to continue this work in the coming year, I keep thinking about the importance of protecting journalists and newsrooms who are vulnerable to targeted harassment in relation to their identity or the beats they cover, such as politics, gender, immigration, and reproductive rights. Several  reports  have shown that women and nonbinary journalists, as well as journalists from the LGBTQI+ community and ethnic and religious minorities, are disproportionately targeted. This harassment sometimes achieves its goal: driving these journalists out of an industry that already struggles to represent diverse communities. Data from the Women’s Media Center  showed  that women of color represent just 7.95% of U.S. print newsroom staff, 12.6% of local TV news staff, and 6.2% of local radio staff in 2018. We must support and protect a diversity of voices in the news industry so journalists can continue reporting stories critical to their local communities and our democracy. If you are interested in more insights from our national survey and in-depth interviews, I invite you to dive into our  report , “Journalists Under Fire: U.S. Media Report Daily Threats, Harassment and Attacks at Home.” We include recommendations for newsrooms to provide for the safety and well-being of their journalists, the importance of collaboration and community, and how supportive editors play a key role in providing a sense of safety. If you are a journalist, editor, or newsroom who does not have access to safety resources, please  reach out to us . We are here to support you.

  "prediction": "Predictions are not exactly the business of the AP, where I work — rather, our mission is trusted, fact-based, independent journalism that is free from influence. And the facts about the current state of the news business are well known — to the point where they’re not exactly news: At AP, for example, support from philanthropy helped us  deepen our coverage  of democracy ahead of the election, and then additional support helped AP provide that content beyond traditional AP members to small, local newsrooms. That meant, for example, that small outlets such as  AZ Luminaria ,  The Colorado Sun , and the  Vernon Reporter  could run AP’s election result interactives, as well as use AP photos and election coverage. A number of newsrooms told AP that this helped free up newsroom staff to do other needed reporting. In 2025, we’ll need more of this, please. Philanthropy needs to step up even more to support local newsrooms along with the underlying infrastructure that helps them succeed. AP has  launched  a new nonprofit sister organization, the AP Fund for Journalism, to help support local journalism. This is a natural fit in an organization that got its start in 1846, when  five New York City newspapers  came together and chipped in for a pony-express route through Alabama to get news of the Mexican War to readers in the north. The crisis in news has led to the blooming of many new, digital-first newsrooms to meet local and issue-related news needs, from  education  to  criminal justice . AP’s role is to help other newsrooms succeed by helping them fill in gaps and needs. I choose to take the rosy view that in 2025, funders will step up and increase investment in a whole host of efforts working to strengthen newsrooms across the nation and continued experimentation on new ways to meet audience where they are.

  "summary": "“Journalists will continue to take matters into their own hands — or spreadsheets — either as entrepreneurs striking out on their own or innovators in established and legacy institutions.”",
  "prediction": "The migration started years ago, and the path from journalist to media operator (mogul?) has become more popular — and profitable. See how Jessica Lessin bootstrapped The Information, Nicholas Thompson  revived  the 167-year-old Atlantic, Vice expats built 404 Media, or former Politico reporters made Punchbowl a massive success. Even local news — arguably the most challenging sector of the business — is brimming with journalists-turned-entrepreneurs who have started their own operations, often out of frustration with former employers. And then there are the many writers who sprung up via (or leapt to) Substack and comparable platforms. Most journalists used to willfully ignore the “business side.” Today, they’re getting much more comfortable with trying to solve the revenue puzzle that bedevils news. My prediction is that journalists will continue to take matters into their own hands — or spreadsheets — either as entrepreneurs striking out on their own or innovators in established and legacy institutions. Over the next year, we’ll see even more journalists venture into the business side of the news industry or adopt those frameworks and concepts by choice into their work. For the most part, this will be a positive development for our audiences and industry. After 15 years in newsrooms, I crossed over to the revenue side several years ago and got my MBA along the way. (I often joke that I provide “translation services” between newsroom and business types.) Meanwhile, I’ve seen this mindset shift begin to take hold, as evidenced by the emergence of news product as an entire field and career track. The shift from advertising to a subscription or membership-based business model has made this more palpable to journalists. After all, most journalists want people to read their stories (is there no better affirmation for your work than if someone subscribes or becomes a member because of it?). And the closer that journalism is to readers (or, in MBA speak, the closer the product is to the customer), the better we can serve them. In Laura Krantz McNeil’s apt  Nieman Reports story , she concluded that newsrooms need people “with a service mindset, who understand how to run a business, but a business with a mission that’s more important than ever.” Absolutely. But on the way, it’s going to get messy. That’s okay, because if we’re not failing, then we’re not innovating enough to survive as an industry. Take, for example, the following Venn diagram of the hedgehog concept — a classic paradigm from the book  Good to Great  by Jim Collins. This has become my go-to framework when I think about new initiatives: Collins’ book has nothing to do with the news industry. But I think we’d deliver more value to our readers and communities if we asked some version of these questions early in the process. Trust with readers will always remain the bedrock of our business. But before anyone reaches for their pearls, remember that the news media industry has been responding to business opportunities and consumer needs for its entire existence. Isn’t an editor asking “Who’s the reader for this story?” the same thing? We should all look to our news leaders to consider both journalistic impact and financial longevity in their decisions. That’s not blasphemy. It’s creating value for our communities in the way only journalists can provide — and ensuring that we’re sustainable in a way that can serve them for years to come. Shira T.

  "prediction": "2025 will bring us a video-first news podcast that will take advantage of massive changes in media consumption to change how global news is covered. It will combine compelling imagery, quality news gathering, and timely reporting to bring the clarity and scope we currently expect from television news directly to our personal devices. A variety of trends are pushing news in this direction. Podcasts are growing as a source of news faster than any other. According to a recent study by Pew, 50% of Americans consumed news through podcasts in 2024, up 9% since 2021. In parallel, video is coming to the podcast medium. Edison Metrics tells us that YouTube is now the No. 1 podcasting app in the United States, and the No. 2 app, Spotify, announced in November it would be adding video capabilities to its podcasts. Many popular sports podcasts made these changes in 2023 and 2024, leading the way. They leverage video to show highlights, feature prominent guests, and create more immersive user experiences. This has happened before. In the late 1960s, network television correspondents used the growth of color television to bring America the truth about the Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam, and political upheaval around the country. Like those changemakers who took advantage of the expansion of color television, 2025’s next-generation journalists will leverage the expansion and continued democratization of video creation and distribution to make citizens more aware of what is going on in their world.

If we are to reap the rewards that AI can afford us, we will need to be able to source the origin of information down to the very last word. That level of transparency will also be the foundation for fair and proper content use and compensation for publishers. In 2025, we will undoubtedly see governments around the world introduce more robust AI policies and regulation. However, in the absence of a consistent global standard, the onus is on content creators to define an approach that puts journalistic integrity first and ensures that intellectual property rights are upheld.

  "prediction": "There’s no doubt that 2025 will be a tough year across journalism. There are many unknowns and more disruptions in store than in years past. One thing I think may seem doom-and-gloom but has a silver lining is the death of the media darling. You know them. They’re the handful of “rising star” news organizations that land big grants and projects continuously. Those places may well deserve the attention they got, but as some of the founders of those organizations step away, it’s becoming clear the ecosystem is going to have to change with the economy. A bill currently in the U.S. Senate, if passed, will be one more jab at the way we support and fund news organizations. HR9495 allows the Secretary of Treasury to designate nonprofits as “terrorist supporting organizations.” Philanthropies and nonprofits are watching this closely, and not happy about it. A  letter  from the Council on Foundations, Independent Sector, National Council of Nonprofits, and United Philanthropy Forum states “the legislation runs counter to constitutional due process protections by placing the burden of proof on the accused organization and providing only 90 days for organizations to demonstrate their innocence before revoking their tax-exempt status.” If it makes it through, any number of journalism nonprofits (both as funders and news organizations) could be targeted because of what they publish, and we know the Trump administration has no love for the media. What does this have to do with media darlings? If I were a betting person, I’d wager there will be fewer large grants and more smaller ones, making distribution arguably more fair, and lessening the potential blow if one (or a few) organizations are hit and have their status revoked. This is already happening. No matter what you think of them, Press Forward is trying to spread the wealth, and there’s been an increase in small one- to two-person organizations popping up,  especially in local . Is that bad? I don’t think so. It could be the rise of a new kind of more supportive, ecosystem-oriented world. Building the bones of this ecosystem will be more co-ops and collectives. These go beyond industry support groups, who do admirable work, because they are a collective of organizations working together. Collaborations don’t have to revolve only around content. Usually they have some shared characteristic, like the  Latino Media Consortium  and local-focused groups like the  KC Media Collective . But others exist to share resources of some kind, whether advertising or technical, like the  Tiny News Collective  and  URL Media .  You can argue the rise of the creator economy is creating a new kind of media darling. That’s possible, and there are people who rise from creator to media entrepreneur, but for now, the majority of creators rely on sponsors, deals, and individual subscriptions (think Patreon). They are, in a way, a small ecosystem of their own. What does all that make? 2025 will be a year with fewer shooting stars, but we’ll start building constellations in a broader night sky. P.

  "headline": "Visual investigations become a mainstay of news",
  "summary": "“Visual investigations are poised to move from niche desks to standard operating procedure in newsrooms in 2025.”",
  "prediction": "Over the last decade, many major news organizations have set up teams and sub-brands devoted to “visual investigations” or “visual forensics.” Their success signals the next major shift in reporting practices. Similar to “data journalism” before them, visual investigations are poised to move from niche desks to standard operating procedure in newsrooms in 2025 as their tools and techniques become more accessible and known to non-specialists. The high degree of visual documentation that’s available today, from eyewitnesses with smartphones via surveillance cameras to satellite imagery and street view–style footage, has made images of events abundant in many cases. As journalists’ competency in such forensic-style analysis of visual material rises (thanks in part to pioneering efforts by actors like BBC, The New York Times, and Bellingcat), this practice will become a mainstay of journalism. The “classic” visual investigative story gathers swaths of visuals and other data — typically in one central timeline — to recreate a past event and illuminate its critical moments through visual documentation and models. While the most ambitious projects — extended documentaries and 3D-model recreations — might still be reserved for the largest and most resourceful newsrooms, many of the individual techniques and approaches that make up such extensive investigations can be successfully adopted by smaller newsrooms and individual journalists. As the foundational analysis techniques of visual investigations become widely known in journalism, it’ll quickly become apparent that they can enhance the reporting on almost any type of news story. Norwegian media’s collective push to build and spread verification and forensic analysis of visual material to more newsrooms after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine offers a glimpse of what’s to come. Outlets like VG, Norway’s largest daily, now use visual investigative techniques when reporting local run-of-the-mill stories. Visual investigations will go from a niche in investigative journalism to standard newsroom practice. This will redefine how regular stories are researched, fact-checked, and reported. The increased focus on visual investigations in journalism mirrors the importance visual material has in society, which is not likely to end anytime soon. While forensic analysis and verification will be essential going forward, they will not always be enough. Journalists will need to pair technical verification with contextual analysis to uncover what visual material reveals, what it excludes, and how it shapes competing narratives. The continued success of any visual investigation hinges on this dual approach. Ståle Grut  is a doctoral research fellow of the Photofake project at the University of Oslo. "

  "headline": "All eyes are on Brazil",
  "summary": "“If humanity is to overcome the unprecedented threat of weaponized disinformation and digital populism, Brazil is an essential fort to be held.”",
  "prediction": "Last November, Brazil’s first lady was involved in an unusual altercation during the G-20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro. During a panel about disinformation, Janja Lula da Silva was defending tougher social media regulation when she heard a loud noise in the background. “I think it’s Elon Musk,” she  said . “I’m not afraid of you…fuck you, Elon Musk.” To which the X owner replied on his own social media platform: “They are going to lose the next election.” The exchange reveals more than a gaffe committed by Brazil’s first lady. It shows how much the world’s most outspoken tech mogul pays attention to my country. Why would Elon Musk, who is set to lead something called the Department of Government Efficiency in the incoming Trump administration, care who wins the next election down here? Well, he does care, and so should every journalist who covers the information wars. After Trump’s comeback, Brazil is next. Over the past few years, a series of crises have taken place here, a country where 84% of the population (212 million people) uses the internet and where,  according to  the Reuters Institute Digital News Report, 74% get news online. Like the U.S., Brazil has seen a political group make use of disinformation as a tool to gain power and attack enemies, the press, and other institutions. Led by former president Jair Bolsonaro, several well-mapped disinformation campaigns managed to erode popular support for the electoral system, and sow doubts about the possibility of fraud in the 2022 elections. The former president and his followers used the cry of “fake news” to attack the Supreme Court and the Electoral Court, and to instigate an insurrection that tried to overthrow the newly elected government of Luis Inácio “Lula.” The similarities between the Capitol invasion of January 6, 2021 in the U.S., and the invasion of government buildings in Brasilia on January 8, 2023,  are so striking  that one could say both leaders followed the same playbook to subvert a legitimate election. But, after the coup attempt failed, Brazil took a different route altogether. While in the U.S., the judicial system moved slowly, Brazil’s Federal Police built quite a strong case against Bolsonaro, with thousands of messages, documents, and testimonies informing an indictment against the former president. Even before that, in 2023, Bolsonaro had been banned from running for office again. In February, this year, his passport was seized. He cannot flee the country. Bolsonaro has adopted a narrative in which he is the victim of an “authoritarian” Supreme Court that wants to censor his freedom of speech. Meanwhile, Brazilian journalists have learned a lot about how digital populists are using media manipulation to destroy democracy. We’ve adopted a variety of strategies to deal with disinformation campaigns. We know how to quickly identify a fake news campaign online and its culprits, as well as how to reduce the use of the mainstream media to spread them. We have learned to combine data journalism with shoe leather reporting to identify how these misinformation networks are formed, coordinated, and funded — often with public money. We have adopted concepts from academia and allied ourselves with some of the key experts in the field of disinformation. We have created and shared methodologies to establish what is a simple organic misinformation wave and what is a systematic, structured, disinformation campaign. We developed linguistic models, monitoring stations, and AI-powered tools to help out. We’ve come a long way. Other institutions have also tried to fight back. Once again moving in a different direction than the U.S., our Congress responded to Jan. 8 by trying to regulate Big Tech to improve safeguards for users and establish the corporations’ responsibility for criminal content spread by their algorithms. The move was seen as crucial to these platforms’ agendas because Brazil is one of their largest markets. So the legislation was  stonewalled  by commercial interests. Google went as far as to use its search homepage, used by more than 90% of internet users in Brazil, to say that a draft bill would “make the internet worse.” That’s when Elon Musk enters the stage. Doubling down on an already explosive political situation, earlier this year he decided to confront the Supreme Court and accuse its most prominent justice, Alexandre de Moraes, of “censoring” X after he refused to suspend accounts that were spreading disinformation and threats against authorities. Claiming his “absolutist” defense of freedom of speech, Musk joined the Brazilian alt-right in calling Moraes “a dictator.” The beef escalated with the closure of X’s offices in Brazil, which was followed by the suspension of the platform in the entire country for over a month. In the end, Musk backed down, appointed a legal representative in the country, and paid a fine, and the service was reestablished. Just like the Supreme Court, the federal government has not backed down on its quest to confront Big Tech. Just a month later, Lula’s administration led the G-20 meeting and managed to insert the need for social media and AI regulation in the final draft signed by 80-plus countries. While it’s unlikely that Big Tech regulation will advance in Trump’s U.S., Brazil, the hemisphere’s second-largest democracy, has a civil society and a free press that has learned the urgency of establishing rules in the digital far west. Unfortunately, we also know that it won’t be easy, and that tech oligarchs such as Musk will continue to pay special attention to Brazil. They know that what happens here could influence the entire region — and maybe the world. This is a battle for the future of information integrity, journalism, and democracy. If humanity is to overcome the unprecedented threat of weaponized disinformation and digital populism, Brazil is an essential fort to be held. That is why my prediction for journalism in 2025 — or maybe it’s wishful thinking — is that all eyes of the global media should be focused on what happens in Brazil.

  "headline": "We stop excusing the lack of accessibility in news",
  "summary": "“Alt text not only makes the content accessible but also enhances search engine optimization and improves the newsroom’s reach. It also just makes your news organization look like you have your shit together.”",
  "prediction": "As we stumble into 2025, the conversation around accessibility in journalism is more relevant than ever. As news organizations try to engage wider and more diverse communities, accessible content isn’t just a moral imperative — it’s also a practical one. Yet many newsrooms still overlook even the most basic accessibility elements of publishing, even though most require a relatively low lift and can have a disproportionately high impact. The good news is that publishers don’t have to jump straight into the deep end to get started. One easy starting point is to simply provide accurate, human-edited transcripts for video and multimedia content they put out. This basic first step makes a huge difference and ensures that those with hearing impairments — and the  growing population of people who simply enjoy consuming content with subtitles on  — can access and enjoy your work. It’s the same thing for alt text, one of the easiest accessibility enhancements out there. Adding it to images, along with descriptive text for published or hosted web content, is essential for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers. Alt text not only makes the content accessible but also enhances search engine optimization and improves the newsroom’s reach. It also just makes your news organization look like you have your shit together. As I’ve said before , accessibility isn’t just about serving people with disabilities — though that should be front and center in these conversations. It’s also about improving the overall user experience for everyone. Screen readers, immersive readers, and other accessibility-first features that provide audio narration alongside text have become increasingly popular among users without disabilities, and I expect that trend to continue into 2025 and beyond. These tools offer an enhanced, flexible way to consume content, whether someone is multitasking, driving, or simply prefers an audio component to  help improve reading comprehension . One of the most common excuses for neglecting accessibility is an apparent lack of time or resources. However, advancements in AI tools — I know, I also cringe when someone brings up AI these days, but bear with me for a minute — can actually help get you started. (I can’t stress enough that these tools on their own are  trash . There’s no getting around it. They just don’t have the juice or the cultural and colloquial capacity to be effective on their own. But when used as a tool or in an assistive capacity alongside an actual human, they’re not completely useless.) Most of us have already used or experimented with transcription tools like  Otter ,  Descript ,  Whisper ,  Rev , and others. If you’ve used these tools before, you know how useful they can (sometimes) be for capturing the bulk of the conversation and turning it into a searchable, synced transcript. Yes, you still have to go through and edit transcripts for accuracy, correct spellings of names and places, and other unique or uncommon words. But if accuracy and fidelity are too much to ask of you and your news organization, you might be in the wrong business anyway. When used properly, these tools can serve as a quick and valuable starting point for most video and audio transcripts. Meanwhile, platforms like WordPress include built-in prompts for alt text creation and  tools to help you generate them . I’ve even loaded a  series  of  alt text  and  descriptive text   guides and resources  into a custom GPT ( like this one ) or a Claude Project, along with a few custom instructions and guidelines, to create tools that provide alt-text first drafts for images and graphics meant for my own social media posts and the  Center for Cooperative Media’s  various websites. Again, they’re not perfect, and they still lack the intuition, nuance, and insight of an actual human. But as long as you pair these tools with human oversight, they can help streamline the process, save you time, and improve the quality and potential reach of your work. Starting with these simple first steps, newsrooms can open their doors to millions of potential new readers and viewers who were previously excluded and treated as an afterthought (at best). After all, why would you want to exclude  the nearly 40% of American adults who reported some form of disability ? Making content accessible isn’t a niche accommodation or something to pat yourself on the back for — it’s a necessary, simple, and strategic move that demonstrates respect for your community and a commitment to actual diversity and inclusion. Accessibility is the future of journalism. Newsrooms that embrace these practices  now  are setting themselves and their staff up to not only meet the needs of their current audiences but are also positioning themselves as leaders in ethical, inclusive media for years to come.

  "prediction": "You’ve seen them yank endorsements, sand down headlines, play both sides, and bend the knee at Mar-a-Lago. There’s a movement in media c-suites to get right with Donald Trump, or at least to be a little less antagonistic. It’s going to fail, and it’s going to fail badly. News organizations had established something of a playbook during the first Trump era. Head-on challenges to the fashy right competed with the pretend-objective “view from nowhere.” Old-fashioned muckraking was rebranded as a defense of democracy and the rule of law. The suits were never quite comfortable with the approach, which could feel one-note and preachy on its lesser days. But for a while, it was seen as good for business and traffic, and maybe the right thing to do. That started to change in 2022, when CNN’s new owners installed Chris Licht as the network’s CEO. Some of the more vocal anti-MAGA voices were out. Down-the-middle was back in. Trump got himself a town hall. It was a disaster. CNN’s core audience — and many of its staffers — saw the new direction as a betrayal of the network’s mission. Trump fans had a whole other network that spoke to them. Ratings  collapsed . Advertising revenue  plummeted . Licht was gone after 13 months.  Yet somehow, his tenure became something of a template. Maybe not at CNN, which command-Z’d many of Licht’s changes, but definitely elsewhere. Media execs, in ways subtle and not, began to rewrite a playbook that they had come to read as too sanctimonious, too willing to follow left-wing orthodoxies.  Some did so in the most self-destructive ways possible. The most notable was Washington Post boss Jeff Bezos, whose decision to spike an endorsement of Kamala Harris 11 days before the election cost the paper more than 250,000 subscribers. (At least a $50 million error, by my back-of-the-napkin math.) Bezos didn’t make things better by tweeting his “ big congratulations ” to Trump after the election, or pledging to “ help ” him. But at least Bezos didn’t make like Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, who agreed on Fox News to “ redo the entire paper ” to make it more MAGA-friendly. (His executive editor had to  email the staff  the next day to say the boss didn’t really mean it.) Even if he did, it wouldn’t work. There’s no evidence that moving to a both-sidesy middle will bring in new readers, and plenty of evidence it won’t. Over the last decade — but especially this year — audiences have moved away from establishmentarian, middle-of-the-road outlets, and towards voices they see as raw and authentic. That’s one reason why Joe Rogan and Alex Cooper’s podcast studios became such important stops on the campaign trail this time around, and why CNN has consistently had so much trouble catching Fox and MSNBC in the ratings. The “view from nowhere” is inherently unappealing. Trump’s hardest core is completely poisoned against mainstream media brands, and no amount of right-wing commentary will provide an antidote. The rest of us can see right through a brand of mock objectivity that hides the facts it pretends to showcase, like when The New York Times  transformed  Trump’s eugenics vitriol into his “long fascination with genes.” Business Insider’s Adam Rogers calls it “ a view from distinctly somewhere  — a place outside petty intellectual and earthly concerns. It’s the confidence of people who think they’re beyond the chance of consequences.”  It’s the confidence of people who think they can kiss Trump’s ass and he’ll leave them alone. There’s even less evidence for that belief. On the contrary, Trump has regularly attacked media allies like Fox News for stepping one foot out of line. On December 4, the incoming president  went after  Fox’s sister organization, The Wall Street Journal — a paper which has a famously conservative editorial board, but also the temerity to note that Trump’s pick to lead the D.E.A. had withdrawn.  News outlets can handle the social media rants. But Trump has also repeatedly tried to tie media companies up in bogus lawsuits that drain attention and resources. On Halloween, Trump’s lawyers  demanded $10 billion  in damages from CBS for not editing a Kamala Harris interview to his liking. In early November, Trump’s lawyers  threatened  the Times and Penguin Random House with another $10 billion hit for a book and a collection of articles he deemed unfair.  As president, Trump will have the ability to do worse. His  pick to run the FBI , Kash Patel, once said he’d “come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.” Patel’s allies now say he was just using “hyperbole” to prove a point, as if his boss hadn’t threatened revenge on a broad range of enemies, including some in the press. Trump’s already threatened the broadcast licenses of CBS and ABC. He called for NBC — the network that gave us “The Apprentice” — to be  investigated for treason . His cronies, now poised for major administration positions, want to reverse Biden-era rules limiting when  the government can grab reporters’ emails, texts, and phone records . Trump went further,  publicly fantasizing  about the prison rape of those journalists who don’t immediately comply. “You might add the publisher and editor to the list,” the once-and-future leader of the free world added. That might explain why some of them are hustling to get on Trump’s good side, but it doesn’t mean it’ll have the desired effect.

  "summary": "“They’re choosing compliance with eyes wide open, trading their watchdog role for a seat at the billionaire’s table.”",
  "prediction": "The warning signs were there before the election. In October, The Washington Post announced it would no longer endorse political candidates. The Los Angeles Times followed suit. These weren’t principled stands for neutrality. They were previews of how mainstream media outlets plan to handle Trump’s second term: with kid gloves and bothsidesism that would make 2017’s coverage look aggressive by comparison. We’ve seen this movie before. After 9/11, mainstream media outlets abandoned their role as government watchdogs, instead becoming cheerleaders for the Bush administration’s march to war. Reporters who questioned the official narrative were sidelined or fired. The New York Times famously published Judith Miller’s incorrect WMD stories on the front page while burying skeptical reporting. Dissent was treated as unpatriotic. But this time could be worse. Media billionaires aren’t just staying quiet — they’re actively courting Trump’s favor. The coming wave of media consolidation means these owners have a vested interest in keeping Trump happy. After all, they’ll need his administration’s approval for mergers, favorable regulatory decisions, and continued tax breaks. The signs of this pre-emptive surrender are already visible in how outlets frame stories about Trump. Headlines have gotten softer. Coverage of his most extreme statements gets buried. Stories about his plans for retribution against political enemies are treated as horserace politics rather than threats to democracy. This isn’t just about editorial decisions. It’s about ownership. When Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post and needs government approval for Amazon’s various ventures, how aggressively will the paper investigate Trump’s corruption? When Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times, needs regulatory approval for his medical companies, will the paper push back against Trump’s attacks on science? The truly chilling part is how unnecessary this capitulation is. Trump didn’t have to threaten these outlets directly — their billionaire owners are preemptively repositioning them to avoid conflict. They’ve learned the lesson from Elon Musk: Playing nice with Trump can be very profitable for the ultra-wealthy, even if it means sacrificing integrity. Independent journalism won’t disappear entirely. But it will be increasingly marginalized, drowned out by the “mainstream” outlets that have decided maintaining access and avoiding conflict is more important than telling uncomfortable truths. Stories that should be front-page news will be relegated to specialty publications with smaller reach. The bitter irony is that this voluntary surrender won’t protect these outlets from Trump’s attacks. He’ll continue using them as punching bags to rally his base, even as they bend over backwards to appear “fair” to his administration. But their owners calculate that performative criticism is preferable to actual accountability journalism that might threaten their bottom lines. For those who remember post-9/11 journalism, this feels eerily familiar. But at least then, the press could claim they were caught off guard by an unprecedented national crisis. This time, they’re choosing compliance with eyes wide open, trading their watchdog role for a seat at the billionaire’s table. The question isn’t whether mainstream media will hold Trump accountable in his second term — they’ve already decided not to try. The question is whether enough independent voices can survive to fill the vacuum they’re leaving behind. Parker Molloy  is the writer of  The Present Age  newsletter. "

While journalists don’t know exactly the speed at which harm may be coming for various demographics and communities, we know harm in various forms is growing. If I were running a local newsroom right now, I would focus on figuring out how to support their communities through crises. This includes all manner of catastrophe: climate disasters, economic collapse, cultural and other identity threats, infectious diseases (hello, bird flu), cybersecurity…you get it. My prediction is that local journalists, editors, and news leaders will find themselves navigating one or more of these crises in their communities. But if they prioritize the following, I predict that not only will their communities be far more resilient, but their organizations will too. If a newsroom does all of these things, there’s still not a guarantee that it will survive. But nobody gets out of this life alive.

  "summary": "“The fracturing of the internet has been painful, but it’s also given us the chance to rebuild the media by focusing on our shared humanity.”",
  "prediction": "The last few years have been plagued by the collapse of discoverability on the internet, which have helped fuel the destruction of many media companies’ already fragile business models. AI slop, AI-powered bots, and tech companies’ obsession with shoving AI into every part of their platforms have made the internet noisy and hard to navigate. Social media, meanwhile, has fractured. It’s harder than ever to sustain an ad-supported media business by doing commodity journalism and hoping to win the traffic slot machine on an increasingly broken internet.  This state of affairs has been devastating for media companies and the journalists who work for them. But the AI-ification of the internet and the end of easy traffic created by SEO-ing and keywording every article to death offers a huge opportunity for media companies (and independent journalists) who believe that their audience is other human beings, not a search or social media algorithm.  Along with three other reporters, I cofounded  404 Media , an independent, journalist-owned publication. We decided early on that we’d show our readers who we are and how we do our reporting; that we wouldn’t hide our perspective on the topics we cover; and that we’d be transparent about the challenges facing not just our business but the media industry more broadly. We’ve found that this approach has made people trust our reporting more, not less. We also decided that we could not build a successful business that relied on constantly changing our strategy to suit whatever social media platform happened to be driving traffic or paying media companies at the time.  Older internet technologies — namely email and RSS — are still some of the best for directly reaching readers, and newer decentralized ones like Mastodon’s ActivityPub and Bluesky’s AT Protocol look increasingly promising. We’re using these tools, combined with very public explanations of why we’re using them, to build a sustainable future for our company, one that is hopefully replicable by other small newsrooms. The fracturing of the internet has been painful, but it’s also given us the chance to rebuild the media by focusing on our shared humanity.  Media companies that replace their writers with AI, continue to chase traffic by doing the same articles everyone else is doing, and focus heavily on appeasing social media platforms will continue to struggle. Media companies that invest in quality journalism that is not easily replicated by machines and who treat their audience with respect by giving them articles, video, and podcasts that respect their time and humanity will earn readers’ trust and subscriptions.

  "summary": "“Using the right language isn’t the be-all and end-all of better disability reporting.”",
  "prediction": "To create an accurate record of history, news organizations in 2025 must become serious about the disability beat by understanding and actively resisting  ableism .  That’s more crucial than ever with an incoming president whose rhetoric  falls in line with fascist logics and beliefs  and whose appointees for various health positions ramp up chances for misinformation about disability to spread. Take Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Trump’s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services — someone who has  promoted scientifically debunked conspiracies , from “vaccines cause autism” to “HIV doesn’t cause AIDS.”  Disabled people make up the largest minority group in the U.S., with  over 1 in 4 people self-reporting a disability in 2022 . It’s also one of the most fluid: Anyone can become disabled temporarily or permanently at any point, and unfettered spread of COVID-19  continues to disable people . But ableism in language and practice runs rampant. Intellectual disability is  again being mocked  as people  in the Silicon Valley right  like Elon Musk share racist pseudoscience around  whether some races have higher IQs than others . Having a mental health diagnosis raises the likelihood of  employment discrimination  and a  loss of legal autonomy .  Eugenics and ableism have  historically gone hand in hand . Nazi Germany’s fascist campaign was  propped up by eugenicist science  that first  began in the U.S.  to cull “undesirable” populations, including disabled people. Early 20th-century eugenicists used terms like “imbecile” and “moron” to dehumanize intellectually disabled people, paving the way for involuntary segregation into  abusive and neglectful  institutions.  The U.S. is  only now finally working to close a loophole  that let employers pay some disabled people a subminimum wage —  many of them intellectually and developmentally disabled . Last year, around 30% of  disabled people lived at or below the poverty line .  And there are manifest improvements to be made within journalism.  Many disabled staffers are freelancers . At  The Sick Times , none of the four staffers are able to work full-time due to the current budget (though it is growing!). Often-ableist industry expectations around job performance can prevent disabled journalists from holding staffer positions, and  the crip tax  — the term for the added costs of living with a disability — on top of  sub-par wages in journalism , make the career even less sustainable, especially with the risk of further disability from COVID-19 infections in workplaces without  precautions like cleaner air or masking requirements . Most of the full-time reporters covering disability are white, which can result in intersectional stories about disability across different races and ethnicities falling through the cracks.  Some newsrooms have started to acknowledge this history of ableism by covering and considering disability more seriously. The Washington Post  has an accessibility engineer .  WBFO  (Buffalo’s NPR station),  The New York Times ,  Mother Jones , and  The 19th  are among the outlets that have dedicated reporters or fellows to covering disabilities.  The Sick Times , where I work as a podcast producer, is dedicated to covering long COVID and other infection-associated chronic illnesses.  IRE’s AccessFest , an all-virtual conference, is one effort aiming to retain the quality and access initially ushered in during early pandemic years. There’s now a guide around  frames for reporting on how young disabled and chronically ill people use online spaces , too. And there are more efforts to create community among disabled journalists, including the burgeoning  Disabled Journalists Association  and Society of Disabled Journalists.  Style guides like the National Center on Disability and Journalism’s  Disability Language Style Guide  have provided an example for  moving away from ableist language  and encouraging a rejection of the  long-standing journalistic pattern  of stereotyping disabilities. But using the right language isn’t the the be-all and end-all of better disability reporting, says  Emyle Watkins , the disability reporter at WBFO. While they’ve seen more interest in training around better disability coverage, “overall the thing I see in the media that really bugs me — all these outlets want to do the very, very bare minimum and get [just] the language right.” “There is no dictionary for this,” they said. “We’re working with human beings…instead, train your employees to not be afraid to think about what ways they’re being ableist and…deeply understanding ableism.” Ableism isn’t just about disability. It’s  intimately connected to other forms of structural oppression  and has always been.  If newsrooms want to cover that seriously, they must begin analyzing ableism seriously — across journalism’s culture, history, and frames. And that also means investing in the disability beat in 2025 and beyond, particularly by creating institutional support for disabled writers: “Nothing about us, without us” is true of newsmaking, too.

  "summary": "“AI drastically reduces translation costs while enhancing quality, far superior to basic translation services and without needing an army of translators limited by their daily output.”",
  "prediction": "Is artificial intelligence ready to transform my content into other languages with cultural precision? The answer is that it’s almost there, and by 2025, it will reach its full potential, making now the perfect time to develop a multilingual and multicultural strategy. Artificial intelligence enables our content to be translated not just into another language, but with the cultural nuances unique to each language. The possibilities are endless: from English to Spanish, Mandarin, Portuguese, Italian, or Swahili. From Spanish to German, Russian, French, or Zulu. From Portuguese to African languages in its former colonies. These are some examples of what could be achieved. It’s not a crazy idea. AI has exponentially improved translation quality, and we already see agencies like the Associated Press partnering with OpenAI for translations. For example, each translated piece from English to Spanish ends with a specific note: “This story was translated from English by an AP editor with the help of a generative AI tool.” That disclaimer contains two key elements: machine assistance and human editorial oversight, forming a perfect balance. The opportunities are clear. AI drastically reduces translation costs while enhancing quality, far superior to basic translation services and without needing an army of translators limited by their daily output. This opens a tangible opportunity for more, better content across various languages, with human intervention focused on validating the information, ensuring it’s accurately translated from the original. Media outlets experimenting with markets limited by language barriers will find that AI aids even with regional expressions — something previous translation methods struggled with. Consider the global Spanish-speaking market: 548 million Spanish speakers worldwide, 474.7 million of them native speakers, a market several times larger than the entire United States. In the U.S., 2022 census data reports a Hispanic market of 63.7 million people. Thirteen states boast over a million residents, with an average age of 30.  Does this not scream opportunity? The Hispanic market’s purchasing power is on the rise, as detailed in the  U.S. Latino GDP Report  published by the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture and the California Lutheran University’s Center for Economic Research and Forecasting. The total economic output of Latinos living in the United States in 2021 was $3.2 trillion, up from $1.7 trillion in 2010. If Latinos living in the United States were an independent country, its GDP would be the fifth-largest in the world, larger than the GDPs of India, the United Kingdom, or France. In Spanish alone, the business of content translation is rife with opportunities, and depending on each media outlet’s audience characteristics, the same will be true for other languages. It will all come down to adopting the right strategies, and by 2025, we will see many of them unfold. Benjamin Morales-Meléndez  is managing editor of  Diario Libre  in the Dominican Republic. "

Musicians  Dead &amp; Company  will bring 18 shows to the Las Vegas Sphere throughout 2025. Immersive entertainment — an exhibit where you become part of a show by using all of your senses, solving mysteries or going deep into storytelling — is everywhere. And that’s not all. Community zines run by mutual aid groups, recurring networking events created by Facebook moderators, and even magazines are making comebacks.  While media organizations continually need to work to earn back trust from audiences, people have moved to entertainment mediums to create connections. They could be sharing fandom around a roller coaster, like the bagpipes playing out Six Flags favorite  Kingda Ka . Or putting copy into a pamphlet at a co-working space. These experiences create a shared joy that provides a mission, a means to provide information and a sense of togetherness. They encourage stimuli direction and ease cognitive load, which makes learning and remembering easier. Where does that leave us? Now we move offline. We move to figuring out where people are when they need the information we can provide, and what format is best at that time — like using SMS during a storm that’s knocked out electricity rather than an article. Now, we look at interactive entertainment for the psychological cues they give — like a magician indicating where to look in a way that’s pleasing and logical to our brains — and try to imagine how we can adapt to that kind of information processing. Now we consider how storytelling leaps from the page to the street. It’s the time to quickly adapt to understanding that our jobs are about providing information in ways that are for the audience’s use cases, not testing the understanding gap of how they use our formats.

  "summary": "“2025 should be an opportunity to ask ourselves if we are in a position to cover people fairly.”",
  "prediction": "If the media wants to survive, it must work on trust and represent people fairly. If 2024 was a year of enormous media challenge in this “unique year for democracy” — with half of the world’s population voting for their elected representatives — then 2025 needs to be a year for deep reflection and real change. The big election year taught us that the media isn’t giving people what they need and want from the news: stories that represent them fairly and reflect  their  worries and struggles in daily life, not journalists’. In November, after the U.S. election, a friend told me in shock that her “ultra-progressive” neighbor had voted thinking of the next day’s meal, and had no interest in putting the discussion of rights upfront if there was nothing to eat on the table. She had never found a story in the media about people in her area not buying essential goods because they became unaffordable. Something similar happened in the Mexican election in June, when some journalists were shocked by the incumbent party’s overwhelming victory. But this isn’t the first time we’ve seen this phenomenon. In the  2021 Digital News Report , Richard Fletcher raised the question of whether newsrooms “primarily staffed by relatively wealthy, urban, liberal-minded journalists could ever really understand people who think, vote, and live differently to them.” That year’s data showed that younger people, people with low incomes, and people with lower levels of formal education tend to trust the news less. The  2024 Digital News Report  again showed how much of the public doesn’t trust most news most of the time. Just 40% of the respondents across all 47 markets say they trust most news. After reflecting on the lessons of this past year, 2025 should be an opportunity to ask ourselves if we are in a position to cover people fairly. Are our own teams diverse and inclusive enough that fair coverage of “people like me” is just natural? The role of media leaders is crucial in this appointment. Ensuring the kind of diverse teams that can connect with a diverse audience starts with a leader who promotes a culture of inclusiveness in which people feel safe through their ideas, identity, and ethnicity. An inclusive and diverse team that trusts in its leadership would find the space to show vulnerability and transform it into strength to cover stories from the people who need more representation in the media. Last year,  my prediction  was about the urgency of giving readers hope and journalism’s responsibility to listen to an audience feeling emotionally drained by the news. We continue on the same path. If, in 2025, the media wants to increase the audience’s trust — and, therefore, survive — it must work on representing people fairly. Hopefully, we’ve already learned that fair coverage will only happen if our teams themselves are diverse and inclusive enough to understand the inequality, injustice, and hate stories that genuinely affect people and should be an indispensable part of the news the press delivers.

  "headline": "Publishers reckon with dark patterns",
  "summary": "“News organizations will have to reckon with their use of designs that place them in the same categories as annoying sales sites and scammers.”",
  "prediction": "A significant amount of media attention and scholarship has focused on mis- and disinformation in news, centering both the platforms that allow news organizations to share misinformation as well as the news organizations that have published misinformation — whether about public health, the elections, or disaster relief. The attention on this kind of deception is warranted, having impacts on the distribution of public resources, safety, and democratic outcomes. Although studying how we might fix deceptive news content is a major concern, equally important is addressing manipulative designs aimed at audiences. In the mid-2010s, a design issue that received major attention was that of native advertising — pieces of content designed to look like news articles but which are made to be persuasive vehicles for other organizations. News audiences respond negatively to these designs. A similar phenomenon is happening with dark patterns. Dark patterns, also called deceptive designs, are those user interfaces and experiences made to extract something of value that the organization otherwise would not get. Researchers have found dark patterns on shopping sites, games, and other web-based and mobile sites. The popularity of a site increased the potential for it to have dark patterns.  One 2020 investigation found  that of 240 popular mobile apps, 95 percent contained at least one dark pattern. News sites aren’t exempt from containing dark patterns. These designs are used in consent notices, political communications, and advertisements. That dark patterns allow the sites to get something of value that it otherwise would not points to the continuing battle that news organizations have with creating and sustaining audience trust and their economic interests. Disagreement exists over whether the paying audience for news  has really shrunken , or whether audiences are more discerning about the kinds and organizations to which they will subscribe. But news organizations can obtain value from audiences outside of subscriptions. Dark patterns allow for the collection of time, attention, and data, all of which can be monetized for value through  ads and ad networks . And news organizations also employ data collection and processing technologies  like cookies  on their sites and apps. To be sure, not all of the dark patterns that news organizations employ involve digital technology. Audience members have  reported having difficulty unsubscribing  from certain news organizations, having to call customer service instead of being able to cancel their subscription online where they signed up. The regulatory environment for dark patterns is changing and will affect news as well as other organizations that deploy them. In October, the Federal Trade Commission announced its final  “Click to Cancel”  rule that requires companies to make it as easy for customers to end their subscriptions as it was to enroll. The recently enacted European Artificial Intelligence Act prohibits “ the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposefully manipulative or deceptive techniques. ” These and other regulations have the potential to change the landscape of deceptive designs. Perhaps more powerful for forcing design changes will be the continued negative reactions from news audiences. Audiences do recognize deceptive designs, and deception or perceived deception affects audience trust. Major controversies during 2024 elections demonstrate that when audiences lose trust in news organizations,  they will leave . Therefore, news organizations will have to reckon with their use of designs that place them in the same categories as annoying sales sites and scammers. If the idea is to maintain their audience and that audience’s trust, news organizations must change their relationship with the audience through interactions on their sites and apps.

  "summary": "“They provide reporting power, youthful energy, and diverse viewpoints that can help expand audiences.”",
  "prediction": "As a lifelong journalist, it’s been disheartening to watch the election and its aftermath. Like many readers, I’ve always believed that if you just show the audience the truth or if you uncover wrongdoing, people will act and demand change. But I’ve spent the last few weeks questioning my vocation. The divided news ecosystem originated decades ago. But this year’s election brought into stark public view just how divided we really are. How do we reconcile the most idealistic vision of journalism with the state of our body politic? I haven’t come to any great solutions and, like many of you, I’m pondering what role journalism plays now. The one thing giving me hope is partnering with student journalists as part of The Intercept’s Rising Student Voices initiative. I spent the past semester working with six talented student journalists at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and their professor,  Erin Siegal McIntyre . We chose this partnership because we wanted to tap into how young voters in a key swing state were approaching the issues and candidates on the ballot. These young journalists uncovered stories that were slipping under the national radar. They offered unique perspectives and campus access that seasoned reporters often miss. We covered the basics — research, interviewing, editing, fact-checking — while also working through real-time reporting questions and ethical dilemmas. Working with students has uncovered angles we wouldn’t have found otherwise. They surfaced impactful stories, from  a homeschooler running for North Carolina’s top education post  to  how the nation’s largest public universities are trying to stifle protests on campus . It was heartening in the days after the election to see their determination to continue their reporting projects. Some plan to finish their pieces even after the semester ends. I believe student journalists are an untapped resource — one that more newsrooms would be wise to partner with. They provide reporting power, youthful energy, and diverse viewpoints that can help expand audiences. If we want to cover news deserts and grow our reach, student journalists can be a part of the solution. I hope more newsrooms will embrace partnerships with student journalists. The benefits go beyond just the stories they uncover. It’s an investment in the future of our industry and our democracy. While most of the students in our cohort probably won’t go on to become reporters, I believe it was a worthwhile endeavor. By experiencing the reporting and editing process, and being compensated for it, hopefully these students will not only become regular Intercept readers, but more importantly, discerning news consumers.

  "prediction": "Threats to journalistic independence are appearing at increasing rates  worldwide , including in established democracies — a situation which, frankly, deserves more attention than it often receives. These threats have now crossed a new threshold here in the United States. As Maria Ressa, a  Center for News, Technology &amp; Innovation  board member, reminded us in  her remarks  at the International Center for Journalists Awards dinner recently, it only took former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte “roughly six months to crumble our institutions,” including freedom of the press. The U.S. isn’t immune to this risk and the loss of protections for independent journalism we’ve guarded for so long. Perhaps this has been a very needed wakeup call. This does not, however, mean journalism of the past. Just as so many other parts of society are evolving alongside technological change, so too is journalism, and in dramatic ways. Journalism absolutely still requires what is at the heart of dedicated reporting, what CNTI advisor Rana Sabbagh called in her  ICFJ award speech  “the refusal to give up, the refusal to crouch in fear.” But it also requires much more. Journalism today is a process. One that requires the collaboration of journalists, technology companies, researchers, policymakers, civil society and the public. It requires (1) journalists to do critical reporting, (2) technology that enables information gathering, distribution and access, (3) research to shed light on current realities and ways to enhance the digital media landscape, (4) a public that finds journalism relevant, accessible, and worth their involvement, and (5)  policies  that support and protect all of the above. It takes all of these parts of society — and all of us — for journalism to function in the critical ways societies need. Too often discussions forget, or ignore, the  full  picture. Let’s have 2025 be the year we double down on journalistic independence and all that it takes to safeguard journalism’s critical role in society.

  "prediction": "In 2025, journalism education will face another challenging year. With  declining student enrollment  in journalism and mass communication programs,  increasing workloads on educators , and curriculum challenges with depth and breadth of covering the basics of newsgathering while providing the latest skillsets, journalism education has its work cut out for itself. As the news industry continues to face more cuts and the less-is-more strategy in 2025, journalism educators will need to continue to be realistic about how to best prepare students for the future profession. The journalists of tomorrow need to be resourceful, innovative, critical, creative, as well as one step ahead of the rest. Journalism educators will be inspired to seek out united efforts with others to navigate this challenging year. Groups like  ONA ,  NICAR/IRE , as well as the  Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication  will continue to provide important resources, workshops and events for educators to gather in the coming year. However, more is needed. Journalism educators and programs will be inspired to see how educational collaborations can evolve with groups like  Trusting News ,  SRCCON , and the  News Product Alliance  among others in 2025. Journalism educators will also be empowered to collaborate with each other to navigate curriculum and enrollment challenges in the coming year. It’s through these efforts that journalism education will be transformed in 2025.

  "headline": "The media industry adopts an insurgent strategy",
  "summary": "“Insurgents succeed because they know exactly what they are fighting against.”",
  "prediction": "General Douglas MacArthur once said, “In war, there is no substitute for victory.” In 2025, the media will heed this wisdom as it adopts an insurgent strategy to transition from survival to sustainability. Rather than playing by the rules of dominant platforms and entrenched forces, media organizations will redefine the battlefield, leveraging unconventional approaches to disrupt the status quo and reclaim their relevance. Insurgents succeed because they know exactly what they are fighting against. The media industry must confront bad actors — whether misinformation campaigns, coordinated attacks on journalism, or exploitative platforms — with precision and determination. Incrementalism is no longer an option. Media insurgents must act with urgency and boldness, recognizing that the stakes are nothing less than the future of an informed public and a functioning democracy. Like insurgents in warfare, the industry will prioritize agility, asymmetry, and the mobilization of resources. Instead of competing directly with platform-driven giants, media organizations will exploit vulnerabilities — emphasizing niche storytelling, hyper-personalized content, and community-driven initiatives. They will leverage emerging technologies like AI to streamline processes and amplify their storytelling capabilities. Collaboration will be key: Media insurgents will actively enlist allies from inside and outside journalism, forging partnerships that turn shared interests into collective power. To truly succeed, media organizations must embrace what might sound heretical: propagandizing their mission — not with bias, but with conviction. Building a belief in journalism and civic engagement must start early, through initiatives like funding civic education programs, partnering with schools and places of worship, and integrating journalism into the curriculum. The insurgent knows that support is earned by defining the fight clearly and compellingly. There are only two outcomes: victory or defeat. And defeat becomes inevitable when the mission is left in the hands of others. The insurgency will also punch back. Media organizations, intermediaries, and funders must develop robust countermeasures to debunk false narratives, expose bad actors, and protect the integrity of information platforms. Through transparency, advanced fact-checking, and strategic partnerships, they will respond with speed, accuracy, and moral authority, reinforcing their role as defenders of truth. This insurgency will transform the media industry from defensive survival to offensive resilience. By embracing clarity of purpose, bold action, and collective resolve, the media will reclaim its role as an indispensable pillar of democracy. The stakes are clear, the fight is inevitable, and victory belongs to those who act decisively and refuse to let others define their story. Saba Long  is executive director of  Atlanta Civic Circle .

  "prediction": "I want to share a news storytelling provocation for 2025, coming from a toolmaker who’s been building media prototypes with LLMs over the past year. My hope is that these capabilities will spark ideas from readers working in newsrooms. First, I’ll share what I’ve noticed in using AI in creative tools and interfaces: Second, here’s what I’ve noticed in media over the years: We’re caught in this tension. Social media pushes us toward simpler messages — bolder headlines, punchier takes, everything feels flattened. Yet at the same time, the world grows more complex, and stories must have more nuance, more context, and more perspectives. We can move from flat to dimensional stories with the new interfaces powered by LLMs. I’ve been prototyping what this might look like: These interfaces offer new ways to think about how we understand complex information. When you let readers explore stories spatially rather than linearly, you tap into the strong human intuition for spatial understanding. When you give them tools to transform text — to simplify it, expand it, or relate it to their own context — they engage more deeply. The LLM text generation in these tools does not replace articles and stories, it augments them. For a familiar example, consider a table of contexts — it doesn’t replace the text, it augments the experience of reading. The capabilities are here, and now it’s a matter of bringing them to expert storytellers. This coming year, we’ll see more “dimensional” interfaces that let readers explore stories from multiple angles and depths. The bold headline grabs your attention, and then becomes a gateway to deeper exploration and understanding. Now is the time to reimagine what news stories can be when we augment them beyond the constraints of the flat page. Kawandeep Virdee  is a creative technologist at Google Labs. "

  "summary": "“There are good comments sections online, but they’re never an accident.”",
  "prediction": "“Don’t read the comments.” It’s advice editors often give writers when their first piece goes viral online. Yet it’s always struck me as odd guidance — why publish on the internet, a medium built for interconnection, only to ignore how readers respond to your work? What “don’t read the comments” almost always really means is “our comments section is trash.” And a trash comments section is reflective of a larger, longer-term mistake of not investing in moderation. In the best circumstances, the web’s interplay creates something magical: Writers share insights while readers — often writers themselves — deepen the conversation and add valuable context. It’s a meaningful interaction for all involved, and a reliable level for growth, if done well. And yet. We’ve all witnessed comment sections deteriorate, whether on a single post or across an entire platform (see:  x.com ). One key difference between thriving and flailing online spaces? Well-crafted moderation policies, effectively enforced. 2025 will amplify an existing trend: the growing divide between online spaces that invest in moderation and those that don’t. X’s  first transparency report since Elon Musk took over  shows the platform received over 66 million user reports of hateful conduct in the first half of 2024, but suspended only 2,361 accounts. Part of the reason is likely the change in direction of its content policy over the last few years, including  removing protections  for transgender users. And many platforms are doing what  TikTok did in October  — laying off human content moderation teams and replacing them with AI. Bluesky, meanwhile, recently announced it was  quadrupling the size of its content moderation team . Readers want some level of protection from hateful content. They want a robust, understandable set of rules about what conduct is and isn’t acceptable, and the knowledge those rules will be enforced fairly and consistently. There are good comments sections online, but they’re never an accident. It takes intention, focus, and the will to have rules and believe in them to create a shared online space that works. This year we’ll see that tension — the laissez-faire approach vs. robust moderation — play out across the web in ways big and small. Engaged readers will be watching.

  "summary": "“If hospital and prison chaplaincy work taught me anything, it’s that, unfortunately, crisis is a precursor to this kind of change.”",
  "prediction": "I was ready to break up with journalism in 2020 when I decided to go to divinity school for a chaplaincy degree. My physical, mental, and spiritual burnout was real, but so was an emerging sense of hope because of the hundreds of mutual-aid networks and uprisings that cropped up that year. I realized that, instead of leaving the field altogether, I needed to go harder on breaking up with some bad habits the industry (and this includes the emerging nonprofit wing of the field) had normalized. Given the uncertain, unprecedented political and economic times, I’m praying 2025 will humble more of us to go through these breakups. We deserve better! And more importantly, so do our communities. I predict the endings around us will continue to bring us to our knees and that perhaps that is the best vantage point to reimagine everything. As Detroit labor activist Grace Lee Boggs said, “We have to think not only about change in our institutions, but changes in ourselves.” If hospital and prison chaplaincy work taught me anything, it’s that, unfortunately, crisis is a precursor to this kind of change. (Though not always — some folks double down on the familiar.) I have faith that walking away from three particularly bad habits will make space for transformative journalism. When did sustainability — which Merriam-Webster defines as “of, relating to, or being a method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged” — become synonymous with the capitalistic business of revenue making for our industry? Sustainability should be determined by community ecology models, not revenue models. By linking these two, consciously or unconsciously, we’re missing an opportunity to build long-haul, people-powered infrastructure and going down the dangerous, slippery slope of efficiency. As the prophecy goes, “more money, more problems,” and in this case, it’s not just using environmentally catastrophic tools that cut costs or help us raise more money. Treating journalism like a business instead of a public good is a fast track to erasing “public” and replacing it with “commodified.” A sustainable approach opens up opportunities to collaborate, be it with other outlets sharing back office staff, partnering with libraries to host events or insert another example of building with your community for the sake of care, not consumption. Given the political environment, next year will only seek to divide us further through fear, dismantling this bad behavior now ensures we meet the moment with interdependence not hyper-individualism. Numerous studies about news consumption all sing the same song — communities want information they can act on. I feel like we’ve known this is a toxic habit for a long time, but the climate, political reckoning of the next year will drive it home. What’s fun about the harmful behavior above is that it flows into the habit of conflating impact metrics with growth for growth’s sake. Counting clicks, website traffic, or any number without humanizing, geographizing, or whatever else indicates you know who your readers are is meaningless unless your actual target audience is advertisers, investors, or philanthropy. Treating who reads you as a number is a way to avoid the true responsibility of the press — to hold power to account and educate the public so they can act. We got a glimpse of this in North Carolina in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Some outlets were keeping body count tolls, while others were figuring out how neighbors could learn who around them had generators. So if the high school civics teacher or the neighborhood grandma doesn’t know about you — what difference does it truly make? Perhaps the most insidious habit all of the above begets is our god complex. In his latest book,  The Message , Ta-Nehisi Coates writes: “It is the journalists themselves who are playing god — it is the journalists who decide which sides are legitimate and which are not, which views shall be considered and which pushed out of the frame. And this power is an extension of the power of other curators of the culture — network execs, producers, publishers — whose core job is deciding which stories get told and which do not.” The power we wield as authors of the first draft of history means we’ve been complicit in building the political climate. Our power doesn’t have to be a tool of the oppressor but if we keep emphasizing numbers and growth then it will be. Are we able, as Coates does so profoundly, to point the finger at ourselves and to acknowledge when we’ve been wrong? We know that next year will bring ensuing chaos. I believe these breakups will again be on the table, harder truths to swallow. But I predict that if we let these habits go we will, to paraphrase the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, be choosing community over chaos. Andrea Faye Hart  is the membership director at  Tiny News Collective . "

  "prediction": "The darkness that democracy dies in is here. Some might call that hyperbolic, but as a practitioner, scholar, and close observer of journalism for more than 25 years, I’ve lost faith that well-meaning criticism of journalists who engage in horse-race coverage, false equivalence, and lazy, narrow ways of defining objectivity will make any meaningful difference. The excellent reporting many prominent outlets did about the candidates and their policies didn’t break through to the many voters who either prefer to live in the alternative-facts universe of right-wing media or were  turned off by the absurd sanewashing  of Trump and his allies. This election was decided in no small part by voters who believed a number of  false things  about the candidates  and the country . The Fourth Estate has failed. The only way forward for journalism in 2025 is to prioritize mutual aid and collaboration with people in other fields who have expertise in listening, organizing, and, most importantly, belonging. Unless and until we’re able to bring people together at the local level and start new conversations about how we govern ourselves and build the social capital essential for healthy communities, little will change. Of course, this isn’t a new idea. I and many other engagement journalism practitioners have argued for years that journalists can only address their  ongoing crisis of trust  by listening to and building relationships with the people we serve. These efforts have not been in vain; University of Wisconsin journalism professor Sue Robinson has documented the impacts of no less than 30 journalism initiatives that promote engaged journalism practices to build trust. Her extensive research on these efforts led her to describe it as a paradigm shift to a more participatory form of journalism. The alumni from the master’s program in engagement journalism I founded and led for ten years at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY before coming to Montclair State this fall continue to do meaningful work, as do many others. But it is not enough. Solidarity journalism , which argues that journalists “must stand for basic human dignity and against suffering” by framing stories in ways that “center the lived experiences of people subjected to unjust conditions,” and  movement journalism , which is focused on “collaboration between journalists and grassroots movements, and supporting journalism created by oppressed and marginalized people,” have already developed frameworks and practices we need. It is time for more of us to practice — and even more importantly — fight for these approaches. Journalism schools need to find more ways to collaborate across disciplines in 2025 to expand the skill set journalism students learn beyond reporting and storytelling, and get students in other majors to think critically with us about information, how it is produced and distributed, and the role that it plays in advancing different social goals and building community. The Jersey Bee, founded and led by one of my former students, Simon Galperin,  prioritizes events that connect people locally  and facilitate discussion, shared understanding and collective problem solving, as well as explainer journalism that can help people with solve concrete, basic problems in their life, like how to access reproductive health care, apply for SNAP benefits, or run for mayor. It is unapologetically committed not to reflexive neutrality but to improving the quality of life for everyone in the community, particularly those with fewer resources. If we really care about bringing healthy democracy back, this is the way. The hundreds of journalists Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel surveyed for their book  Elements of Journalism  once agreed that their fundamental purpose was to “give people the information they need to be free and govern themselves.” Those that still believe in this purpose must be committed to a journalism that is not just about informing, but also about belonging.

  "prediction": "For better or worse, I don’t think there will be a “Trump Bump” in traffic to news websites during the second Trump administration. There are a bunch of reasons that levels of interest (and/or shock) aren’t what they were eight years ago: news fatigue, Trump’s (slight) popular vote win, self-preservation. There will surely be some traffic spikes in moments of congressional combat or when Trump announces a particularly egregious executive action — and we’ve seen a few post-election bumps during this cabinet nomination process — but it’s already looking like 2025 will have little in common with 2017 in terms of eyeballs to our respective domains. For those of us who aren’t in the straight political reporting business, there’s an opportunity to cover Trump differently this time. We don’t need to sustain our astonishment or tap into our own panic and worry every time he says or does something heretofore unfathomable. (After all, it’s all fathomable now?) As we prepare for a seismic change in Washington — given Trump’s promises/threats — we can get more attuned to what our audiences need and want from us during this second round of Life Under Trump. Yes, we’ll still explain tariffs and supply chains and why your new iPhone costs twice as much as your last. But we’ll also look at popular culture in a different way, and how people are getting their politics via  Taylor Sheridan , or  Steve Bannon . And we will, of course, still provide escapism with, let’s say, a beautifully  illustrated list of important recipes . It also means that instead of chasing traffic, we will focus more on building membership, and deepening our relationships with our audience.

  "prediction": "August 19, 2023 may well have been the day that journalism’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence began its descent into the trough of disillusionment. That’s when Gannett published a wince-worthy report on a high school soccer match that would have gone largely unnoticed if it had not been obviously written by an AI bot that knew little about sports…and may have also been drunk: “The Worthington Christian [[WINNING_TEAM_MASCOT]] defeated the Westerville North [[LOSING_TEAM_MASCOT]] 2-1 in an Ohio boys soccer game on Saturday.” “Worthington Christian edged Westerville North 2-1 in a close encounter of the athletic kind for an Ohio boys soccer victory on Aug. 19,” the report continued. The mocking of that story — and others generated by a tool  made by an outside firm  and published by the news giant — started immediately. Gannett quickly paused its experiment. For people familiar with  the Gartner Hype Cycle , this was inevitable. The Hype Cycle is a visual representation of the ups, downs, and plateaus of a new technology over a period of time. First comes the Innovation Trigger — in this case, the rollout of generative AI for the lay public in November 2022 (though artificial intelligence had been around and in good use for years before then). Then came the Period of Inflated Expectations, when people could create art with a few simple text prompts (“Look Ma, I can create a green monkey dancing on the moon, and I can’t even draw!”), followed by the almost mass hysteria over ChatGPT when it was discovered it could write school essays, tighten up resumes, imitate voices, and create broadcast scripts. Almost every newscast reporting on the technology had some version of “That report you just heard was written entirely by a robot!” Then comes the inevitable slide into the Trough of Disillusionment, when the hype folks discover that the tech is far from perfect. In AI’s case, there were the “hallucinations,” where the programs simply made up material, and the image generation tools that didn’t take direction well or correctly display the typical number of human fingers on a human hand. But with most technologies that enter the Hype Cycle, there eventually comes the Slope of Enlightenment (“Wait, this technology can sift through a trove of documents and summarize it faster than I can, especially on deadline”) and the Plateau of Productivity. I believe we’re entering the plateau, and this phase will accelerate in 2025. Journalists who were and remain rightfully skeptical of AI and its impact on our profession — from eliminating jobs to adding to the public’s souring on our trustworthiness — are starting to build stuff. Good stuff. Newsrooms such as the San Francisco Chronicle are rooting around in the archives to feed  a bot that can surface restaurant reviews  written by Chronicle staffers to compete with review apps such as Yelp. A company called  Nota , created by former Los Angeles Times technologists, makes a WordPress plugin that can suggest headlines, art, and social media posts for harried editors — who are free to modify the suggestions or discard them altogether. Tools to help with newsroom investigations, such as data-sorting tools and summarizing long interviews, are just the tip of the iceberg, as we come around to the idea of AI being a partner rather than a boogeyman in the newsroom. My students at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism were largely wary of AI at the beginning of my Business and Future of Journalism course at the start of this past semester, but then in groups prototyped eight unique AI-driven bots or tools that help with fact-checking, bias detection, media literacy, and ethical decision making for photographers. Others came up with AI tools to detect fashion trends and gaps in reporting. They know the dangers of AI, but they also now see the promise of this technology. I predict many more journalists will join them. Retha Hill  is director of innovation at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. "

  "prediction": "Anyone with a sunny outlook for 2025 is delusional.  Journalism faces an existential crisis, and whether we can meet the moment collectively will be telling. Here are four areas I predict we will be hearing a lot about in 2025, all interconnected. I spent 30 years in mainstream media, including some big jobs at places like the L.A. Times, CNN, and The Wall Street Journal. At all of them, we twisted ourselves into knots asking why audiences didn’t trust us. It took me much less time through my work at  Epicenter , a local news site launched in Queens during the pandemic, to answer. First, I had to flip the question into the affirmative: How do you gain trust with communities? What I discovered is something social workers and brand marketers alike already know. You help people once and they’ll call you again — and again. That action, of turning to you, seeking you out, represents trust.  And so in the days after helping someone secure, say, a covid vaccine appointment, we found ourselves inundated with requests, non-health-related. Can you help me find an English tutor? Where can I find a one-bedroom for under $2,000 in Brooklyn? This pattern repeated itself after the U.S. presidential election. A sample of the questions we are receiving right now:  We may not have all the answers, but we vow to keep being there for our communities, who seem all too willing to guide our news agenda, if only we keep listening and serving and helping.  It’s no longer enough to meet people where they are. Building trust relies on us actually doing something. Media across sizes and regions feel wildly divided on the role of generative AI in their newsrooms. On the one hand, The New York Times is suing Microsoft and OpenAI alleging copyright infringement. For many local outlets who arrive to news stories months, even years before mainstream media, we know this frustration well: seeing something built on our backs, often not credited, rising to virality and prominence and, perhaps, profit. Meanwhile, smaller publishers have been quick to weave AI into their processes, and leave the impossible fights to the big guys. Most of us don’t have the luxury of creating committees to “study” AI, yet we can’t afford to be left behind. Some of the greatest innovations I see in AI tools come from outlets such as The Jersey Bee, which is mining websites, event listings, Facebook groups, and other online mentions to generate dozens of micro-newsletters every week. At Epicenter, we recently turned to another AI tool, GovWire, to cover an evening community meeting and emerged with a report that is part-human, part-AI and emblematic of what’s possible. We saved about a day’s work thanks to the tool. There are rightful ethical questions over the role of AI in our newsrooms, from transparency and disclosures of who wrote/produced/created what to the displacement of workers already on shaky ground. But righteousness feels a dangerous, privileged perch as the robots march on and ahead.  Only by locking arms can we take control, achieve efficiencies, revolutionize roles, and guide the technology toward serving the greater good.  There is a single crisis in journalism, and from it all other problems emanate: money. In 2025, journalists will have to get more comfortable not just understanding and explaining how their employers make money but being a part of the solution. We can no longer be media companies bragging about the Chinese wall and organized into opposing sides, meaning one side makes money and another spends it. Editorial operations will need to jump headfirst into revenue opportunities such as deeply reported, paywalled content and reports; or data-driven insights around audience and consumption; or events and opportunities for audiences to connect to talent and newsmakers. These trends have been underfoot for some time now. The best example is likely The New York Times’ subscription growth. About a decade ago, a staffer explained to me why the paper was so focused on a subscription strategy: not just to generate revenue, but to unite multiple departments around a common cause.  Today, media organizations, and all the person they employ, need to rally around revenue. I am worried about the number of journalists I meet who have no idea how advertising works, let alone the world of digital media advertising (run, do not walk, to learn terms like CPMs, programmatic, and GAM).  I speak as one of the ignorant. Five years ago, when I left mainstream media to launch my own companies, I thought I had had enough exposure to the business “side.” But it’s taken me landing deals, making payroll and growing customers to internalize these lessons and apply them. When people ask me if the revenue hires of our future really need to understand ad sales, audience growth, philanthropic funding, product innovation, and diversified business models, I say yes to all of the above. Plus, they need to lead with compassion and charisma. I do so not knowing if training workforces adept in such rapidly changing skills is even possible. But they are who we need to helm our newsrooms.  On that note, I speak to unemployed journalists virtually every day looking for work — and also to hiring managers who have scant few jobs but tell me they can’t find the right people despite the hordes applying. This mismatch underscores the talent crisis in our industry.  Right now, it is very, very hard for me to talk to someone who wants to be a journalist and assure them there is a viable path ahead. I decided to embrace the calling at the age of 12 when my family moved from Puerto Rico to New Jersey. I joined the school newspaper and found myself interviewing the principal in my first week. Now I’m 48. I find myself reinventing my relationship with our profession and reassessing my skills at least every six months, often more frequently. Once upon a time, that was more likely an every three- to four-year exercise. I do not know if humans can face such uncertainty and emerge unjaded or unscathed.  So I take those desperate phone calls — two or three a day. Do everything you can, I advise. Use Gemini. Learn Mailchimp and ConvertKit and Beehiiv. Study aggressive audience acquisition tactics. And please, please, don’t forget to report and write. Stay curious. Get comfortable with smaller audiences and hope they might care and connect to what you have to say. I’m rooting for you. S.

  "headline": "Using AI to make news more accessible",
  "summary": "“AI-driven accessibility isn’t only better product design but also good business.”",
  "prediction": "AI is everywhere. Amidst all the doom and hype, newsrooms are discovering a wide range of use cases for AI in journalism and its workflows. However, as with any emerging technology, this often leads to the mindless application of tools. For instance, in India, TV news channels are now filled with  AI anchors . In a market notorious for misinformation,  bigotry , and  government propaganda , introducing an AI anchor does little to address the trust deficit among viewers. This is what I call “using AI for AI’s sake”— employing a tool not to solve a problem or benefit users, but merely as a flashy novelty. That said, globally, there have been excellent examples of AI applications in newsrooms — streamlining workflows, automating tedious tasks, and  aiding investigative journalism . AI is already becoming an integral part of newsroom operations and product development. However, one area where AI is underutilized — and one I believe will gain traction in 2025 — is in making news products more accessible. Thanks to advances in assistive technology and the efforts made by tech giants to bake accessibility into their design, much of the internet is, by and large, accessible. Yet most news platforms continue to be inaccessible. News platforms in the Global South, in particular, often fall short. Even in the U.S. and Europe, accessibility is frequently treated as a bare-minimum compliance measure to avoid lawsuits, rather than as an essential feature. There are several reasons accessibility remains sidelined in newsrooms, regardless of size, region, or language. These include weak regulations, lack of awareness among leadership, and (especially) resource constraints. Many newsrooms, large and small, lack the bandwidth for both the technical overhaul required to ensure accessibility and the day-to-day tasks that support it, such as adding captions, transcriptions, and alt text. These challenges aren’t unique to smaller newsrooms. Even some of the largest outlets in the Global South struggle with accessibility — not for a lack of intent, but because retrofitting outdated tech stacks to meet accessibility standards can be a monumental task. On the other hand, newer newsrooms may prioritize basic accessibility features but lack resources for subtitling podcasts or crafting high-quality alt text. This is where AI can step in to bridge the gap. Earlier this year, we  overhauled the Newslaundry website  to make it accessible. Beyond technical upgrades, we integrated AI into our production and publishing workflows, automating tasks like generating subtitles and transcriptions for podcasts. During my time as part of the inaugural  AI Journalism Lab  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, I was exposed to AI thought leaders and cutting-edge experiments in the field. This inspired me to explore how AI could be leveraged to make news products more accessible. Our accessibility efforts didn’t just make our platform more inclusive — they also attracted new paying subscribers. This demonstrated that AI-driven accessibility isn’t only better product design but also good business. By neglecting accessibility, news platforms discriminate against people with disabilities. In India alone, there are at least 25 million people with disabilities. As publishers face subscription fatigue and declining audience engagement, addressing accessibility could unlock entirely new segments of readers. This is why I predict that more newsrooms will turn to AI in the coming year to make their products accessible. AI can address major barriers to accessibility, from reducing manual effort to enabling cost-effective tech solutions. For instance, imagine an AI chatbot trained on the brilliant  alt-text resources created by the BBC  in a newsroom where desk editors are too swamped to write and add alt text for all images and infographics. Or a tool built on inclusive storytelling guidelines, helping editors save time in checking whether the sources and subjects mentioned in the story reflect the experiences of diverse communities — not just dominant voices in terms of class, caste, gender, and race. Perhaps we’ll even see an AI anchor that genuinely addresses accessibility needs — like one capable of sign language interpretation.

  "headline": "Media companies will love their websites a lot less",
  "summary": "“Websites aren’t where audiences or advertisers are increasingly investing their time or budgets. The patterns in traffic and ad dollars say as much.”",
  "prediction": "The conversation around websites and how to make money from them is louder than it should be. Consider the facts: Websites like The New York Times are not going away, nor is the essential editorial they publish. Businesses will always always need a home base — a place that’s theirs, where they have absolute editorial, experiential, and monetary control. But we’re no longer in the halcyon days of bottomless social and search traffic. And websites aren’t where audiences or advertisers are increasingly investing their time or budgets. The patterns in traffic and ad dollars say as much. In 2025, publishers will learn to love their websites less and ruthlessly prioritize different strategies to maximize audience and monetization potential — strategies that don’t require significant creative or editorial compromises, and provide strong long-term economic upside beyond the date they’re published. What are some of those strategies? Video: It’s back. Again.  Yes, the video that the industry has been “pivoting” to for the last 15 years. At one point, it was too cost-prohibitive to produce at scale. Social and SVOD companies invested hundreds of millions of dollars into it, and that money dried up. We entered into a dark period of hands-in-pans and text-on-screen videos, which resulted in a lot of thrash for editorial teams and their capital investments. There’s an understandable stigma when it comes to the media’s relationship with video. But the risk of becoming jaded to the current video opportunity could be fatal. In the hype cycle, we’re now somewhere between the slope of enlightenment and the plateau of productivity. That’s a good place to be. What’s different now? For HubSpot’s media network, video has become our single fastest-growing content strategy over the last few years and will continue to be one of our largest sources of investment going into 2025. In 2024 alone, we’ve grown views of our long-form content by 47% and increased the return of our video investment through lead generation by 78%. We’re talking 150,000-plus new leads in 2024 from video, and growing. How? An investment in upleveling what you see on screen, increasing long- and short-form output, improving our insights-to-production motion, localizing to more non-English markets, using AI to automate rote aspects of our monetization and post-production processes, partnering with other YouTube creators and domain experts, launching new channels that address underserved markets, believing that videos from B2B companies don’t have to be boring. If you’ve seen what we publish on  The Hustle  or  My First Million , you know what I’m talking about. And we’re a B2B media operation. Going into the new year, all traffic and revenue trends considered, video will continue to become a must-have rather than a nice-to-have for publishers of all shapes and sizes. Creator partnerships: Your editorial and audience extensions.  In the old world, there were capital-J journalism and journalists, and then there was the island of misfit YouTubers and influencers and social media managers and other less prestigious categories of content makers. In the new world, influence is shifting to those once-misfits. In the new world, your distribution is just as, if not more, important as your byline. In 2025, media operators will look to outside, independent creators as extensions of their editorial teams, and as a boon for diversifying audience and revenue. The most successful creators today are the ones who do three things exceptionally well: They’re experts in their specific crafts (sketch comedy, enterprise sales,  Excel speedrunning ), they’re creating content in very shareable and interactive formats, and they’re publishing to personal environments (your subscription feed, your inbox) where content and ad engagement, and CPMs, are highest. The most successful publishers will be the ones building complementary creator programs of external and internal domain experts who wield trust  and  reach, co-producing original video and audio IP with them and, in some cases, building new media brands together. Today, HubSpot’s media network collaborates with over 100 creators — mostly across YouTube and newsletters — in categories like marketing, sales, AI, and entrepreneurship. In some scenarios, we’re the sponsor. In others, like My First Million or  The Next Wave , we’re co-developing strategic relationships that produce original series and new brands. And some, like The Hustle or  Mindstream , we acquire. Why will this approach be opportunistic for media companies going forward? For both of these reasons, it’s a great way to test and learn with emerging talent that you may want to ultimately go deeper with, and to find a model that works best for your own goals. For HubSpot, here’s what drives our strategic decision-making when working with creators: Like video in 2025, creator partnerships will be an essential strategy for how media companies further hedge against an overreliance on their websites for audience and revenue generation. What else should we expect more of?  Email, for one. At a time when first-party data, direct marketing channels, hyper-engaged audiences, and sponsorship premiums are everything media operators want more of, reprioritizing newsletter strategies — owned and partnered — doesn’t sound so boring or overplayed. While oversaturation and deliverability are two valid concerns, as long as you’re not another news digest and you deliver unique value or solve for an unmet need, then the odds are in your favor. Websites won’t go away in 2025. They’ll still be a vital channel for essential journalism and revenue generation. But in 2025, they won’t be the primary focus. Expect a resurgence in video production and creator strategies: two trends that will ensure a sustainable future for B2C and B2B media companies alike.

  "summary": "“The best, most rigorous journalism in the world is powerless to effect change unless it reaches and is trusted by the wider public — however profitable it may be to serve a niche, hyper-engaged subset of the public.”",
  "prediction": "At this seeming inflection point for the future of news, I put the question to the most famous expert of them all and prompted ChatGPT to answer: “What will happen to journalism in 2025?” The response it spat out was a compendium of the bland but familiar, as if it had digested a decade’s worth of previous Nieman Lab predictions (which, after all, it probably had): “Journalism is likely to undergo continued transformation driven by a mix of technological advancements, shifting media consumption habits, and evolving business models.” It went on to highlight a host of familiar “trends and developments” including: Unless you count an oblique reference to news outlets needing to “prove their credibility and combat the rise of ‘alternative facts,&#39;” missing entirely from this list was any mention of Donald Trump. That omission is glaring for many American observers of the news media at this particular moment. After all, the once and future U.S. president just recently closed out his campaign by musing to a Pennsylvania crowd about how he wouldn’t mind if “somebody” were to indiscriminately start shooting journalists. In the weeks since, he has named a replacement for director of the FBI, Kash Patel, who previously warned that the new administration would “go out and find the conspirators not just in government, but in the media.” Patel added ominously, “We’re going to come after you.” Sure, some of this rhetoric may be bluster — and even if not, a second Trump administration may well prove just as incompetent as the first when it comes to executing on its many governing priorities. But Trump and his allies have signaled a take-no-prisoners willingness to use lawsuits, regulatory agencies, and even private-sector acquisitions, to silence news media viewed as “enemies” and boost only the voices it deems appropriately deferential. The actions taken by some wealthy owners of news media both before and after the election does not inspire confidence around the ability of American journalistic institutions to withstand a sustained assault on their independence and wherewithal. While ChatGPT can handily summarize the broad trends battering the news business, the survival of the industry in the immediate future depends on something new: what a small number of specific individuals will choose to do in the face of an erratic, existential threat. The future of news is ultimately a much bigger question then the future of news in the U.S., and independent journalists relentlessly pursuing the truth have been and continue to be critical forces for democracy in far more treacherous environments. But just as Trump has shown a willingness to borrow from the playbook of authoritarians elsewhere, what happens over the next year to American journalism will almost certainly be imported from abroad. As the first Trump administration showed and the most recent campaign laid bare, the best, most rigorous journalism in the world is powerless to effect change unless it reaches and is trusted by the wider public — however profitable it may be to serve a niche, hyper-engaged subset of the public (itself an open question). No doubt there will be some who rally in defense of journalism — perhaps even triggering another temporary “Trump bump” among the news-loving resistance — but publishers and broadcasters risk fates worse than irrelevance if they double-down on the hardened few without regard for the rest of the public. For that public, what used to be called the mass public, the allure of “information” devoid of any connection to the newsgathering processes needed to uncover and verify it, remains strong. Many prefer that information organized and passively curated by platforms — even ChatGPT itself — and they do not care that those platforms are increasingly hostile to the press. Nor do they care what they are missing. They will not save journalism because they remain unconvinced — even blissfully unaware — it needs saving.

  "headline": "We can’t predict the future — but it’s essential to plan for it",
  "summary": "“In our increasingly complex world, to really think about the future of news, we have to think across disciplines: technology platforms, youth trends, global public health, and civic institutions.”",
  "prediction": "On the evening of his election night coverage, Daily Show host Jon Stewart closed out with  a simple pronouncement : “Here’s what we know: that we don’t really know anything. And that we’re going to come out of this election and we’re going to make all kinds of pronouncements about what this country is and what this world is. And the truth is, we’re not really going to know s—.” I was struck by how quickly his team had assembled clips of predictions in the wake of previous elections: in 2008, George Stephanopoulos predicted a post-racial America; in 2016, Democrats concluded that they would need a young candidate in order to win in 2020. Predictions that once seemed like certain realities gave way to unexpected outcomes. But then I realized Stewart’s team could have prepared the same clips and the same message regardless of who won. Whatever the election result, the lessons would still need to be grounded in the same reality: We can’t predict the future. This might be an odd thing to say for someone who’s practiced  strategic foresight  for the past decade. But foresight, despite its name, isn’t about predicting the future. It’s about thinking critically about possible futures so we can make better decisions about the present. It’s especially useful in uncertain times. Susanne Forchheimer at the Institute for the Future (where I’m an affiliate)  defines it  as “the process of turning facts about the present into plausible, provocative, and logical views of the future.” I think that, as a discipline, strategic foresight has much to offer journalism, especially for those in product, strategy, and program roles. Here are four insights I’ve gathered from sharing foresight tools in journalism and product circles over the past year, and why I think this practice brings value to the field more broadly. At the  News Product Alliance Summit , futurist and product leader  Sam Guzik  and I ran an interactive workshop involving  Axes of Uncertainty , a common foresight method for looking at possible futures based on a simple 2×2 of uncertain conditions outside our control. On one axis, our product workshop groups looked at the future of AI: considering a world where newsrooms need to rely on highly centralized AI run by a handful of large corporations against a future in which newsrooms develop their own AI solutions in-house. On the other axis, we looked at the future of revenue: imagining a future where newsrooms are funded through diversified streams and another in which they need to rely on increasingly centralized revenue streams. In each quadrant, participants speculated how the future might unfold — from open source, community-driven AI to an even more precarious funding environment. All of these scenarios seemed plausible, even though not all were preferable. But after laying it all out, we discussed different ways to plan for each possible eventuality. One takeaway: participants reported feeling a lot calmer about the future of journalism after the exercise. Even though the future was no less uncertain, we had some initial ways forward for thinking and planning through the 2×2 exercise. From there, product methodologies allow us to keep embracing experimentation at a lower cost. As futurist  Amy Webb wrote : “Companies, like people, have limbic systems… Your goal right now isn’t predictions. It’s preparation for what comes next. We must shift our mindset from making predictions to being prepared.” At  Media Party New York , I helped prime the hackathon after  Nikita Roy’s keynote on AI and the future of news  with a foresight facilitation method akin to the  human spectrogram . The exercise is simple: share a statement about the future and ask people to locate themselves physically in the room based on what they think. One prompt that really divided the room and sparked generative conversation: “In 10 years, it will be impossible to know what’s real and what’s fake.” About half the room thought it would be impossible, another half thought it would be possible, and a healthy portion stood in the middle. One takeaway: We broadly agreed on the forces shaping the future of truth, like the rise of deepfakes and decreased trust in institutions. But the divergence occurred in how we interpreted the data and what we thought its implications were. The point of this exercise wasn’t to decisively determine the future of truth and trust. The point was to facilitate critical conversations with smart people about what newsrooms can do differently. Media and information flows are ever changing. At the  News Product Alliance Forum at CUNY , I shared about the  Two Curves  model, which helps us see possible futures that are emerging. In the Two Curves model, one curve, moving downward, represents the present way of doing things. Another curve, moving upward, represents a future way of doing things. One curve we discussed six months ago is that today’s way of doing journalism might rely on blog posts, articles and videos, and in the future we may see a greater reliance on influencer networks of trust (a future that has  played out in the 2024 election ). Some signals of change on the horizon that we discussed included:  Grid Zero  and the rise of Instagram as a largely private platform, alongside increased use of other closed networks, like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord;  the epidemic of loneliness  the Surgeon General has warned about in the U.S., which is  increasingly relevant globally  according to the WHO;  libraries as community centers , extending their traditional role as hubs of reading and learning and becoming more social. One takeaway: In our increasingly complex world, to really think about the future of news, we have to think across disciplines: technology platforms, youth trends, global public health, and civic institutions. And even without once mentioning AI, we can already see massive implications for where the future of journalism might need to go — toward a more social experience that relies on networks of trust and community (something  I wrote about in last year’s prediction ). We can’t predict the future, but we have to plan for it, because the future shapes all of us, and we, in turn, shape the future. And for what it’s worth, I learn just as much from being wrong about the future as from being right. To prepare for this article, I looked back on  my first Nieman Lab prediction from 2016 . I noted that “the humble GIF is also on the rise,” I couldn’t have been more wrong. TikTok was released that same year, and it’s transformed our relationship to media. But in asking what I got wrong about that prediction, I learned about other factors that continue to shape short form video and, by extension, news consumption:  the rapid closure of the digital divide , the rise of  sync licensing in the music industry ,  the pandemic’s influence on online user patterns  and even  youth mental health . These factors all contribute to what might be a generational shift in  how and why young people get the news , and it’s worth asking how journalists can adapt. (I’m encouraged to see that  the American Press Institute is doing just that .) Jon Stewart was right: This isn’t the end. It never is. What we see as we prepare for 2025 is another beginning, and now it’s time to make sense of it. The practice of foresight is a discipline, a habit, a muscle that we can develop to make our strategic and product planning more agile and effective. It helps us think laterally and creatively, calm our nervous systems to support more grounded thinking, and continually critically analyze narratives about the future while building new ones. A.X.

  "summary": "“Rather than worrying about AI taking away jobs or isolating us further in society, the best media products will help us connect and be more human.”",
  "prediction": "We’ve gotten through the first part of the hype cycle on artificial intelligence. Just over two years since ChatGPT launched and raised mass awareness of this new technology, and billions of dollars of venture capital later, most people are aware of AI and a good number have tinkered with it. So where do things go now? People don’t care about the infrastructure of your website or mobile app. They don’t care if you’re using Python or Swift, Postgres or MongoDB, Nvidia or Google processors. They don’t care if you’re using generative AI. They care about what it does for them and if it’s actually useful. That’s where things are heading in 2025. Companies have started experiments, built internal tools, and even created their own ChatGPT-like chatbots. It’s now time to truly tap the potential of this technology or else be run over by those who do. It’s time for publishers to build the native AI experiences that power new types of media products. Over the past year, we’ve been working with journalists and technologists around the world at hackathons and workshops to envision this future. We’ve asked people to imagine they are in the year 2030 launching a new media startup, or that they are gifted $5 million from generous donors to fund an AI project. We’ve given them fictional promotions to head innovation labs at media companies, charged with creating the new AI-based product that will become their main revenue source. Hundreds of participants have given  demos , created  pitch decks and organization charts  to visualize this future. It’s hard to think about new media products from first principles, discarding all preconceptions. We’ve tried to push people to get rid of all legacy baggage about what a “news story” should be, to not hold anything sacred or untouchable. In getting people to make this mental switch, there are two big trends driving change now in the way media works. First, AI makes personalization possible to the individual level, shrinking any notion of mass media. Every person can see what they want in the way they want it. Second, legacy media brands are experiencing a crisis of trust, and personality-driven media is taking its place. If we put these two trends together, we start to see glimmers of new media formats and product features. Media takes on the characteristics of algorithmic feeds and conversational interfaces. Everything that we know about a consumer is brought into play, even their biometric data. AI can help with the challenges that have made engagement features too expensive or risky in the past, pitching in to moderate community-generated content, or matching people with shared interests to have a constructive conversation. To get started, media companies who succeed will foster this type of thinking with their own staff. They’ll start by engaging with their community, and make them a part of the product development process. This has the benefit of also recruiting the future community evangelists for whatever eventually launches. Newsrooms will experiment and run internal hackathons to create prototypes. The companies who are succeeding will launch test products with “beta” labels and be open about how things work and might not work, and always be asking for more outside feedback. Not moving at all, or even moving too slowly, is a recipe for obsolescence. As we head into the new year, success will come from remembering what makes media powerful in the first place: its ability to inform, connect and inspire. The best AI-powered media products will create spaces for genuine human connection, foster understanding across divides, and help rebuild trust. Rather than worrying about AI taking away jobs or isolating us further in society, the best media products will help us connect and be more human.

  "summary": "“Much like the state-controlled media systems of the late Soviet Union, the mainstream media has become the of our era — privileged, insular, and increasingly out of touch with the realities of the populations they claim to serve.”",
  "prediction": "The year ahead will be transformative for news and journalism as the cracks in the foundation of mainstream media deepen. The election of Donald Trump — once again misunderstood, dismissed, and maligned by media — has exposed a fundamental truth: The establishment press no longer represents the pulse of the public. Much like the state-controlled media systems of the late Soviet Union, the MSM has become the  nomenklatura  of our era — privileged, insular, and increasingly out of touch with the realities of the populations they claim to serve. It is also incapable of taking a nonpartisan view. Instead of learning from the lessons of 2016, when their collective myopia missed the wave of populist discontent, major outlets (with the exception of a few promising developments in a handful of names) have mostly doubled down on their narrow narratives. The elite retreat to Bluesky is further evidence of the insular mindset. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn predicted in his  1978 Harvard address , ideological orthodoxy now dominates, not through direct censorship but through the internalized fear of deviating from the “acceptable” consensus. The result is a media ecosystem where uncomfortable truths are ignored, and alternative perspectives are framed as threats rather than contributions to the discourse. Yet the alternative to mainstream media — a chaotic “wild west” of independent platforms — brings its own challenges. Much like the  samizdats  of the Soviet underground, these independents have given voice to dissent and pushed beyond the establishment narrative, but they lack structure, standards, and accountability. While their role in empowering free speech and the modern equivalent of  anekdot culture  in the former U.S.S.R. is vital, they remain an imperfect counterbalance to the MSM. Too often, these platforms amplify noise, conspiracy, and tribalism, failing to provide a coherent framework for truth-seeking. 2025 will force a reckoning between these two offsetting media forces. The outcome, if it can be funded independently, will result in the development of a new journalistic norm that bridges the gap between the institutional framework of mainstream media and the dynamism of independent journalism. Unlike Substack, which allows anyone to publish without built-in accountability, or Community Notes on X, which depends on decentralized reader consensus to moderate content, this new model will offer readers a structured but flexible marketplace of values. To gain trust, journalists will have to openly declare their principles so that they can be judged by peers and readers based on how well they adhere to those standards. Peer reviews, blockchain-backed verification, and dispute resolution mechanisms will ensure transparency and integrity while avoiding the murky arbitrariness of traditional editorial hierarchies. In an ideal world, journalists will then self-organize into communities of trust and accountability and readers will engage directly with these value systems, choosing guilds that reflect their priorities, but with the capacity to flag breaches of declared standards. Importantly, such a system will operate on a principle of “innocent until proven guilty.” Authors of disputed content won’t just be cancelled. Monetization will be held in escrow until a fair peer review determines whether it violated the guild’s principles. This should balance the need for freedom of expression with the requirement for accountability, creating a system that combines the best aspects of institutional journalism and independent platforms. Another mechanism that could help fill the credibility gap is the creation of an Annual Disinformation Awards. In 2025, this initiative would serve as a neutral, bipartisan forum to expose the most egregious disinformation campaigns — whether they originate from state actors, political operatives, or media institutions. The awards would allow both sides of the political divide to submit entries highlighting disinformation campaigns pushed by their adversaries, from the downplaying of the Wuhan lab leak thesis to the promotion of false narratives by political fringes. The beauty of this concept lies in its neutrality. By allowing both left and right to participate, the awards would become a tool for critical engagement, exposing manipulation tactics used across the spectrum. This “revelation of the method” would educate audiences about how they are deceived, fostering a healthier skepticism toward all media while forcing journalists and platforms to confront their own biases. All in all, 2025 has the potential to be a pivotal year for journalism. This is especially the case if new models emerge that force mainstream media to acknowledge their role as the new  nomenklatura  and to confront their own biases and blind spots.

  "prediction": "I’m a local reporter in New York City bracing for a second Trump administration in 2025, and what that means both for journalism and the most vulnerable New Yorkers we write about. I fear the federal attack on the press will trickle down locally, and it will be harder to get information through normal channels and freedom of information requests.  This could make it more difficult for reporters to fact check and push for information that’s crucial to our readers. Freedom of Information requests will continue to be delayed.  I’ve already seen some of this covering Mayor Eric Adams, who often obfuscates and deflects when asked basic questions. For more than a year, he’s restricted his “off-topic” questioning to once a week. After his federal indictment in the fall, and since Trump’s victory, Adams appears emboldened by a president who shares his belief that his federal corruption charges are payback for criticism of the asylum seekers coming to New York City. In spite of the mayor and his team’s combativeness,  The City  and other local journalists have to report back to the public — on the mayor’s legal challenges, but also new trash can regulations, on how to join a community board or precinct community council, and what to do if your apartment is too hot.  Journalists will continue to need to be more thoughtful and report news not like a season of “Survivor: City Hall” but on the larger issues with longer-term effects. In response to obfuscation, we’ll have to work even harder to both develop more sources inside government and spend more time outside in the communities we cover. It’s easy to say “focus on the issues that matter,” but that can be difficult; what matters to some voters doesn’t matter to others, and on and on. There needs to be a constant dialogue with the public.  I also fear news fatigue. People want to tune out of what’s happening for their own mental health, even locally. That won’t help existing financial challenges for newsrooms like mine, which rely on support from both large foundations and readers.  Despite the many challenges, The City aims to show people that we’re finding valuable information, even when their public officials don’t want us to. That’s what my colleagues and I will be focused on in 2025.  Katie Honan  is a senior reporter at  The City . "

  "summary": "“We need to seek out these journalist-adjacent actors who share the same goal as many newsrooms of delivering actionable, trustworthy news and information to people.”",
  "prediction": "You don’t have to look further than the recent U.S. elections to see why journalism will evolve in 2025 — and why it must. Candidates bypassed traditional news media in favor of podcasters and social media influencers, an approach strategists  say  helped Trump’s campaign appeal to young men and secure his victory. More than half of men under 30  supported  him. The significance of content creators on politics isn’t new, but it’s  growing  — and we saw that extend far beyond the U.S. in elections across the world this year (take  El Salvador  or  India ). The trend illustrates just how much our civic information ecosystem has transformed since the days when candidates courted newspaper endorsements. Whether you hate it or welcome it, the news media have to recognize it and adapt to remain relevant. In 2025, that means getting outside our lane and taking bold action.  This year, I hope to see more news media pursue innovative, meaningful collaboration with the multitude of stakeholders who today make up the civic information space…the technologists, citizen journalists, researchers, civil society, and yes, content creators who value accuracy, fairness, and transparency. We need to seek out these journalist-adjacent actors who share the same goal as many newsrooms of delivering actionable, trustworthy news and information to people — information that the public can use to make sense of the world and improve their lives and their societies. They just bring different tools and expertise to do it. And that’s needed. Breaking through the information overload that we all experience today has to be front and center for journalism to be relevant and impactful. Cross-functional collaboration among stakeholders in the civic space creates a powerful path for getting there. One example: In 2025, journalists in East Africa will come together with civil society actors and technologists to collaborate on investigative journalism in the public interest. They’ll work through a new investigative hub for transnational collaborative journalism that my organization, the International Center for Journalists, is creating with Code for Africa, a media-focused civic technology organization. Through this partnership, media organizations, civil society actors, and others will have access to partnerships and a diverse portfolio of cutting-edge forensic and AI tools, in addition to training and reporting grants. The end goal is to scale the reach and impact of public interest investigative journalism. At a time when threats against democracy are growing, collaborations like this also enable us to learn from each other and defend against attacks. Together, we can unleash innovation that would be impossible on our own. We can break through the information overload that so many people experience today to deliver relevant, useful information that matters in their lives. And that is what journalism is all about.

Politicians respond by reforming institutions. We call this accountability journalism, and it’s the foundation of the fourth estate. Of course, these linkages were always stronger in theory than in practice. But now they are definitively broken. Voters no longer trust journalists, or institutions — or politicians, if they ever did. Politicians no longer answer to voters, since virtually all votes are guaranteed by tribal loyalty; instead they answer to big donors — or in the case of most Republicans, to Donald Trump alone. Thanks to Trump’s own shamelessness, shaming politicians has become next to impossible. Thanks to the internet, pols no longer need the traditional media to broadcast their views. It’s not that accountability journalism never works. Witness the reporting that forced Trump to back away from Matt Gaetz as a cabinet pick. But that happened only because Gaetz’s actions were even more outrageous than those of Trump’s other nominees. The bar for outrage is being pushed ever higher. This environment distorts accountability journalism like a black hole distorts spacetime. Rather than strengthening democracy, it can start to undermine it. To see how, begin with the fact that, as the historian Timothy Snyder  wrote  recently, “shock is part of the plan.” Trump’s consistent tactic since he first ran for president has been to barrage us with shocks — outrageous statements, ludicrous ideas, horrific policies, wildly unqualified appointments, corruption scandals. The media dutifully reports on each one. Isn’t that our job? But when the accountability linkages are broken, this deluge produces not change, but instead a kind of stunned apathy in our audiences. The message we are giving them is: “Things just keep getting worse, and there’s nothing you or anybody else can do about it.” So what  is  the media’s job? The prevailing doctrine is that it’s simply to report the truth. That’s wrong. Our job is to empower people to hold power to account. Reporting the truth is just a means to that end, and achieves it only when accountability exists. Otherwise, reporting the truth is necessary but not sufficient. Something more is required. What is that something? I think that’s for individual newsrooms to ask themselves; it will vary by the type of journalism you do and who you do it for. But here are a few questions to consider. But activism is different from partisanship. Partisanship is defining democracy as that which Democrats want and Republicans don’t. That would be a mistake. Rather, we should use this as an opportunity for a big conversation about what democracy really is, or could be. And I’m not saying we should stop doing accountability journalism either. If nothing else, future generations will need our first draft of history to understand what went wrong. But it’s no longer enough on its own.

  "summary": "“News organizations will increasingly rely on digital creators not just as amplifiers but as integral partners in storytelling.”",
  "prediction": "A friend recently shared a social media post about a political scandal rocking Jackson, Mississippi. The post caught my attention because it drew on reporting work done by The Marshall Project’s local journalists there. But it generated more engagement than any of our own stories — or those from other area news organizations — had on the same topic.  This moment highlighted a missed opportunity: We’ve spent too much time rolling our eyes at social media influencers who could be pivotal in broadening our audiences. In 2023, The Marshall Project  expanded  its local reporting efforts to Jackson. Our team has worked tirelessly to connect with the community. But none of our coverage gained the same traction as that one influencer’s post. This engagement gap signals how urgently journalism must evolve. For years, journalists have resisted collaborating with nontraditional storytellers, believing credibility comes from formal training and a clear divide between the newsroom and outside content creators. But the media landscape has changed. Today’s audiences, especially younger consumers, get their news through platforms dominated by influencers who make even complex topics feel accessible and engaging. Partnering with influencers may require trade-offs, like easing editorial control or adopting a more casual tone. However, these collaborations offer a powerful way to amplify accurate information and combat misinformation. We’ve already seen how well this can work. The Washington Post’s  Dave Jorgenson  bridges the gap between hard news and entertainment through  humorous, creative content . His videos reach millions, proving that traditional journalism can thrive anywhere. At The Marshall Project,  Chris Vazquez  brings a fresh voice to issues like incarceration, criminal justice reform, and civil rights. A former Washington Post social media staffer, Vazquez connects with thousands of viewers who might not engage with traditional news outlets. His work not only boosts awareness but also sparks conversations around justice reform, showing how influencer partnerships can drive meaningful engagement. This trend extends beyond TikTok. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the BBC enlisted Instagram influencers to share public health messages. This strategy underscored influencers’ potential as trusted messengers, especially in combating misinformation.  The economic realities facing journalism further underscore the need for innovation. Declining ad revenues and competition from digital platforms have forced newsrooms to rethink their strategies. Influencers, with their built-in audiences and engagement, offer a way to reach new readers and potentially secure alternative revenue streams. These collaborations could become a cornerstone of news distribution strategies. By embracing influencers as allies, the industry can tap into its reach and relatability, fostering trust and expanding its audience. Through these partnerships, journalism can continue to adapt to the digital age, ensuring accurate information prevails in an era defined by misinformation and fragmentation. In 2025, the lines between traditional media and influencer-driven content will blur even further. News organizations will increasingly rely on digital creators not just as amplifiers but as integral partners in storytelling. This shift, while challenging, offers a path forward for an industry at a crossroads — one that values both credibility and creativity equally. Marlon A. Walker  is managing editor of local for  The Marshall Project . "

  "prediction": "They say that defining the problem is the key to finding the solution. Much work for many years has gone into articulating the many problems confronting journalism and the media. These problems include: Not to mention the recent election that has provided a fresh list of concerns about journalists as, at best, out of touch…or at worst, enemies to be targeted. There’s been a lot of insightful examination of these very real problems in Nieman Lab plus many other news sources, at think tanks, and in classrooms, conference rooms and beyond. But with all this problem defining, are we getting closer to solutions? We’ve overindexed on problem articulation, to the point of problem admiring. The risk is that we are analyzing ourselves into inaction and irrelevance, all while we continue the search for sustainable business models. All that worrying and scurrying takes time away from focusing on tangible improvements to the processes and products that benefit the people we are supposed to be serving. I predict that in 2025, many news organizations will move into a little less talk and a little more action. Now is the time to find a better balance between exploring the things that are/will/could go wrong versus moving into action mode. What does action mode look like? The specifics will depend on the organization — what it aims to do, for whom, and the capabilities available. There’s no one-size-fits-all, no single right approach to linear or digital distribution, no single perfect business model, no one magic writing style or length, no (re)pivot to video that will work for everyone. But there are some good habits. Broadly, an action-oriented approach includes: Here are some actions we are working on at Hawaiʻi Public Radio that could be applicable to others, most especially in the local and/or public media space: Many people in media stopped approaching the job as a one-way act of pushing out content to the masses a long time ago. But there is still work to be done to be better connected and to truly listen. Questions that lead to positive actions include: What does it look like to be embedded with communities long before a story is assigned or reporting is in motion? How can we better listen and respond during the distribution process on air and online? How can we make the act of broadcasting and publishing a story not the end of a process, but the beginning of a conversation? Where we sit on the planet is distinctive, at the center of the Pacific, a region of great geopolitical importance, on the front lines for trade, technology, rising seas, military, and diplomatic tensions, and with rich histories and cultural traditions. Every news organization has a handful of things it can excel at by nature of its mission, population, geography, and history. Define that, and then act on it. At Hawaiʻi Public Radio, like many public media organizations, we don’t just inform people through journalism. We inspire people through the power of music and the arts. Is music journalism? No. Is it still a vital, essential act of creativity that brings people together across genres and generations, sparking joy and wonder at what humans can do? Absolutely. And, music is storytelling. That’s why getting out of our buildings and into conversation with people and communities is more important than ever. A very good action for journalists and all staff is to be more visible and present in more places, to show curiosity and interest, to get to know more of the people we seek to serve. This isn’t about source or story development — it’s about human connection and being rooted in place. Meredith Artley  is president and CEO of Hawaiʻi Public Radio. "

  "headline": "The New York Times will hire a pro-Trump columnist",
  "summary": "“It may be a challenge to find a writer who can channel the viewpoint of the American voters who favored Donald Trump in 2024 while still honoring the principles of responsible journalism.”",
  "prediction": "In January 1973, two months after Richard Nixon’s resounding election victory, the New York Times announced that it was adding a new columnist to its opinion pages: William Safire, a speechwriter for Nixon and his vice president, Spiro Agnew. Safire would go directly from bashing news outlets like the Times on behalf of a dishonest, press-hating administration to one of the most prestigious posts in American journalism. Safire’s appointment provoked howls of protest from many Times readers and staffers. The paper received nearly 200 letters about Safire in the months after his hiring, 92% of them critical. Editorial-page editor John Oakes wrote to the publisher urging him to fire the paper’s first ever conservative columnist, saying Safire’s articles “degraded the Times” and represented “an insult to its readership.” (The memo is preserved in  Oakes’s papers  at the New York Public Library.) Safire remained, and the Times has continued to employ conservative pundits ever since. Today the paper has 19 regular columnists, 4 of whom are conservatives. All four, however — David Brooks, Ross Douthat, Bret Stephens, and David French — are Never Trump conservatives. These writers have taken a principled stand (and I happen to think three of the four are excellent columnists). But using them to provide ideological balance on the page, as if they represented a widely held viewpoint among today’s Republicans, is wishful thinking at best and willful ignorance at worst. New York Times publisher A. G. Sulzberger  stated  in December 2023, “Today we have a far more diverse mix of opinions, including more conservative and heterodox voices, than ever before.” Yet there are no voices representing MAGA, the dominant strain of thought on the right. I expect this to change in 2025. Sulzberger and executive editor Joe Kahn, in  multiple   interviews ,  have   expressed  a dogged insistence on hewing to the ideas of objectivity and balance,  even  when  it   angers  their left-leaning subscriber base. Of course, a potential subscriber backlash is not the only argument against hiring a pro-Trump columnist. The MAGA movement’s authoritarian underpinnings, enmity toward journalists, and disregard for facts all contradict the fundamental values of The New York Times (and most other independent news organizations). It may be a challenge to find a writer who can channel the viewpoint of the American voters who favored Donald Trump in 2024 while still honoring the principles of responsible journalism. Some might say none of this really matters, because the opinion pages of newspapers no longer dominate political discourse the way they once did. Yet in a twist I’m sure no one predicted, the  biggest media story  of the 2024 presidential campaign centered on  editorial-page endorsements . In this instance, the Times stood out by issuing a full-throated  endorsement  of Kamala Harris and denunciation of Donald Trump, sparing it the torrent of  resignations ,  subscription cancellations , and scorn that The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times received for their last-minute decisions to endorse no one. The Washington Post already has a pro-Trump columnist, Marc Thiessen, who has been writing for the paper since 2010. (Like Safire, his previous job was as White House speechwriter for a Republican president.) The Los Angeles Times, in the weeks after the election,  hired Scott Jennings  (a pro-Trump commentator who had been writing occasional columns for the paper since 2019) to join its editorial board. Those two newspapers also have a longer history of publishing columnists whose right-wing views clashed with their editorial-page ideology. The Los Angeles Times, despite shifting from the right to the center in the 1960s, had a roster of columnists in that decade which included the segregationist James L. Kilpatrick, the National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr., and a press-bashing defender of the extreme-right John Birch Society,  Morrie Ryskind . The Washington Post published Kilpatrick’s column as well (though only after he had renounced segregation), along with the right-wing duo of Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, plus its in-house conservative George Will, who recently received a glowing  tribute  from the paper on the 50th anniversary of his column. The New York Times, compared to these competitors, has historically shown extreme reluctance to grant unabashedly right-wing writers a regular spot on its opinion pages. But the paper’s current leaders seem to dread being perceived as part of the resistance to Trumpism. The odds are that they will cave to reality and hire a columnist who actually believes in today’s dominant right-wing ideology, like it or not.

  "summary": "“Journalists can fall into a trap of parroting the language provided by officials, whether that’s law enforcement, the courts, politicians, academics, or subject-matter experts.”",
  "prediction": "As we enter the new year, journalists need to reassert vigilance about the words we use and whether our choices play down the severity of conditions other humans face. Too often, the humanity of our sources gets diminished in the rush to report. One area that most concerns me is how the Trump administration plans to approach immigration following the campaign pledge to deport millions. Already we see terms like “ border-area ranch ” being used to refer to a Texas facility that is proposed as a detention center. This isn’t the first time the U.S. has used language to create a gulf to separate people the administration has deemed to be a threat. During World War II, Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order that led to the forced detention of more than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry. Two-thirds of the detainees were U.S. citizens; they lost their freedoms, their property, and their livelihoods. For decades afterward, what happened on U.S. soil to our fellow Americans was regularly referred to as “internment,” which disguised the traumas inflicted on intergenerational families and caused long-term epigenetic harm. It wasn’t until 2022 that The Associated Press  updated its stylebook guidance  to note that the shameful events of WWII should not be considered internment but incarceration. Journalists can fall into a trap of parroting the language provided by officials, whether that’s law enforcement, the courts, politicians, academics, or subject-matter experts. It’s essential to take the time to think through the nuance of words we use in our coverage (and the ones we choose to omit). Copying “official” phrasing without providing further context might unintentionally advance a one-sided perspective. Multiple resources exist to help us navigate topics with which we might lack familiarity, including The Marshall Project’s  Language Project  for guidance on how to report on the carceral system and Street Sense’s  Homeless Crisis Reporting Project .  Language, Please  offers an overview for a range of topics that require greater sensitivity and compassion in news coverage. If we go into 2025 without applying critical thinking about how the words we use have the power to illuminate — and obfuscate — then we’re failing in a key duty as journalists: to inform the public with accurate information. And accuracy means providing dignity to people in our coverage. Doris Truong  is a journalism inclusion expert, facilitator, presenter and consultant. "

  "author": "Simon Allison",
  "headline": "News websites hit an evolutionary dead end",
  "summary": "“The next great digital media product will capture all of the best qualities of an old-fashioned newspaper, and more.”",
  "prediction": "The news website is dying. It’s about time, too: Websites are terrible at distributing news. When the internet was fresh and new, it made a lot of sense for media houses to experiment with this new technology. My former employer,  the Mail &amp; Guardian , is rightly proud that it was the first-ever African news organization to set up a website, way back in 1994. Since then, almost every newspaper in the world has followed suit. But the experiment has failed. Let us count the ways in this handy listicle (perhaps the only type of story that does actually make sense on a website). One:  News websites are ugly. Most of them. Has anyone ever printed out the homepage of a news website to hang on their wall? Do you remember news websites in the same way that you remember iconic newspaper front pages or magazine covers? No and no. Two:  News websites require readers to make far too many decisions. Let’s take The Guardian’s homepage, which is one of the cleanest out there. I just counted: As of 11 p.m. Central African Time on December 3, there were 211 separate places to click. You want me, the reader — already overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information available to me — to absorb, process, and then decide between  211 different choices ? This is an abrogation of our responsibility as journalists in the 21st century. We’re supposed to help people to cut through the noise, not add to it. The format of a news website prevents us from doing that job. Three:  We’ve normalized “cookies,” but don’t let the innocence of this term deceive you. Almost every news website on the planet puts behavior tracking software onto their readers’ devices, and sells the information gathered to shady, entirely unaccountable third-party companies. This may be standard practice on the internet — but it shouldn’t be. And it especially shouldn’t be for a news organization attempting to build a relationship of trust with a reader. Four:  News websites live and die by traffic, and traffic is determined by the needs of algorithms, not people. Anyone who has worked in a modern newsroom knows that this reality informs headline writing, caption writing, story placement, and sometimes even the angle of a story. There’s an argument to be made that search engine optimization is one of the most insidious forms of editorial interference ever invented. And we are letting it happen, in return for — what, exactly? Certainly not a major payday. Five:  We all know the economics of a news website don’t make any sense. I can’t think of a single example from the African continent of a legitimate news organization turning a profit on the strength of its website alone. If your primary product is a news website, the history of modern journalism suggests that it is almost certain to fail — no matter how good the quality of the journalism that appears on it. So let it fail. Try something different. There are alternatives. Take Pambazuko, a Tanzanian newspaper that celebrated its 100th edition in early December. It  has a website  and social media presence, but its main product is a PDF designed to look like a newspaper — a “newspaper without the paper” — that gets distributed via WhatsApp. That PDF has, in two short years, made it Tanzania’s most widely read independent news outlet, with 25,000 subscribers and an estimated circulation in the hundreds of thousands. Given the country’s authoritarian bent, and long hostility towards independent media, this is an extraordinary accomplishment — and a testament to the power of their particular model of digital journalism. Pambazuko’s stunning growth supports a hypothesis that the newspaper for which I work,  The Continent , has been testing: Newspapers are not dead. They just need to evolve. But news websites are an evolutionary dead end, because they misunderstand the fundamental appeal of a good newspaper: a curated, tightly edited, high-quality, beautifully designed, completable package of news. There’s no good reason for news websites to exist. The next great digital media product will capture all of the best qualities of an old-fashioned newspaper, and more; it will be divorced from algorithms, search engine optimization, the 24-hour news cycle, and the whims of erratic billionaires. Pambazuko may or may not have cracked it already — they’re still searching for a sustainability model — but at least they’re trying. Not enough media houses, especially better-resourced ones, can say the same. Simon Allison  is cofounder of  The Continent . "

  "summary": "“It was never about the size of inventory and the pricing. It isn’t about the transaction. Independent bookstores are about relationships and community.”",
  "prediction": "The next time you find yourself leisurely browsing the shelves at your local independent bookstore, ask yourself how that store is still in business. Haven’t those little indie stores faced massive existential threats — multiple times? And yet they persist. Take a good look around, because that little store might just hold some answers about how to succeed in journalism and media in 2025. Think about the Goliaths that indie bookshops have been up against. The first things that were supposed to kill them were the big-box book chains — think Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, Books-A-Million, and Crown — that rose to prominence in the early 1990s. At its peak, Borders alone had 511 stores across the U.S., each featuring a massive selection and deep discounts. How were small shops supposed to survive the Wal-Martification of bookselling? Then a few years later, in 1994, came Amazon, with a virtually unlimited inventory of books at even more deeply discounted prices, delivered right to your doorstep. Then came ebooks, which made that inventory available instantly at loss-leader levels of discounting.  Each of these advances was heralded as the death of small independent bookstores — and yet the indies are still standing. Better yet, most independent booksellers are stronger now than ever. So why is that? Because it was never about the size of inventory and the pricing. It isn’t about the transaction. Independent bookstores are about relationships and community.  Customers support bookstores because they love books and the culture of books. They believe books improve their lives, the lives of others in their area, and create connection and a sense of community around the belief that books open you up to the world of different experiences and ideas. Books help us understand and see the fullness, complexity, and value of others. Books are about learning from those ideas and experiences to inspire ourselves to be better and live life more aware and connected to the world and our community. That is what customers are supporting when they patronize their local independent bookstores. They believe in this so much that they’ll go through an inefficient and less convenient buying experience to purchase a book — with little or no discounting on price — to make sure that bookstore is always available to them. Not buying the potential connection between indie bookstores and the worlds of journalism and media? Then take the paragraph above and every time you see the word “books” substitute it with “journalism,” “podcasting,” or “local news.”  The advances in measurement and understanding of user preference that have come with the digital revolution have brought so many positives, but I think those benefits have blinded us to the less quantifiable emotional connections between what we make, the people we make it for, and to the stewardship of the community of users, viewers, readers, and users that we create. Conversations about the short and long-term future of media are peppered with CPM, conversation rate, pageviews, monthly uniques, average consumption, and time on site that we don’t see the real connection between us and our audience. This leads us to rarely, if ever, ask: Why are they really here? What problem or need draws them here? And what satisfaction is at the core of why they stay and come back? In the years since independent booksellers faced all these existential crises, many stopped to think about these questions. The answers led them to stop obsessing about volume, selection, and price — and lean more into relationship building. And it worked: You may have noticed that the one-time inventory and price disrupter Barnes and Noble is surging back and thriving (opening more than 60 new stores this year with plans for even more next year)…by embracing many lessons taken from independent sellers it once wanted to put out of business. Is this the key to success in journalism and media? Well, I was about to type that it is only one small part, but now, as I write this, I actually do think this  is  the key. This mindset will lead to other ideas, approaches, and understanding — seeing the customer/consumer as more than a datapoint on a spreadsheet. And when we look at the big successes of 2025 and beyond, we’ll see this point of view reflected in how they approached this moment.  Just like that tiny local bookstore.

  "summary": "“We got here through nearly 600 years of editorial choices, in one story after the other, from the birth of the printing press to today.”",
  "prediction": "We know the beats before we hear them. The crime stories that permeate our phones, laptops, TVs, and radios repeat the same narratives so many time. Every day of our lives, we can expect to see images of police tape outstretched, red and blue lights flashing, sirens blaring, officers inspecting a crime scene. We can expect to hear about harm and violence, to know someone as a killer before we even know their names or their histories. Perhaps we’ll see the tear-streaked faces of parents, spouses, children, and neighbors as untold grief unfolds. This all happens so quickly.  The criticism of this kind of coverage also feels like it’s been repeating on a loop. We know there’s not enough context or care, that too few solutions are reported, that there’s too much fear-mongering that harms certain communities — especially Black and Brown ones. Following the election, journalists, researchers, and organizers looking to change how journalism is practiced are both motivated and drained, longing to connect and deeply fractured. We’re not on the same page about whether to focus more on incremental wins or invest in transformative strategies. It’s become routine for me to hold space for people who don’t agree, debate this with colleagues, then become even more tired as the country’s political turmoil exhausts them further. Something that fascinates me about our world is that we frequently frame incrementalism and transformation as inherently opposed — when a lot of newsrooms and organizations seek both. The same newsrooms that resist overhauling their editorial policies often want to engage Black and Brown news consumers they haven’t before. The same advocacy groups that finger-wag newsrooms for failing to change enough often copiously track the small wins for their impact reports. As someone who has worked in both spaces, I’ve seen journalists and organizers alike implement strategies for slow-inching progress and systemic change simultaneously, whether they identify with one approach more than the other — then show up to meetings debating them as an either/or. These also feel like repeating cycles.  In my role as a program manager at  Free Press , where I work with journalists and community members to change crime coverage, I study the history of how journalistic practices have and haven’t changed, and it’s taught me a lot of lessons. Here are two of them: Incrementalism happens regardless, and we’re going to keep inheriting unequal editorial norms until we give them up.  We didn’t just wake up with this type of crime coverage. We got here through nearly 600 years of editorial choices, in one story after the other, from the birth of the printing press to today. It’s a colonial lineage where traditions that originated in Europe crossed the Atlantic and evolved to define everyday life on this land solely from the perspective of new white arrivals, not from everyone.  It’s important to remember that the coverage we have today descends from one of the earliest genres of print media, where pamphleteers would explore crimes in grave detail. These were often moral stories, straight-up sermons even, where people could be defined as either good or bad. Deep-seated fears about murder were storytelling fodder. Early European settlers used these stories to share accounts of violence in the colonies, as Indigenous people and enslaved Africans experienced genocide and slavery and resisted both. Even before the United States became the United States, both true and fake accounts of Black and Brown people committing harm or revolting spread in early newspapers. Race in the news could be code for who to fear, for how we see violence, and for who should be punished. Yes, race relations have evolved, but newsrooms continue to pass that dynamic down. The immorality of racial disparities in how journalists cover violence, safety, life, and death are all industry norms that have ancestors. I continue to see dehumanizing coverage that appeals to fascination with gruesome details, coverage that strums deep-seated fears and delivers news on tragic events in a style that feels like infotainment. A lot has changed, but not enough. If we want to change what’s stayed the same for so long, I’d argue that incrementalism won’t work. You cannot maintain cultural safety, value Black and Brown lives, establish multicultural ethics, share power equitably, or reject exploitative storytelling through baby steps or sometimey-ness. These conditions are materially present or they aren’t. If we can’t produce these conditions, I predict that we’ll keep repeating ourselves.

  "prediction": "There are pivotal, life-altering moments when access to trusted information and expert analysis is critical. Cast your mind back to 2020, when news of a deadly coronavirus was all-consuming, and we needed to know: Am I safe? Are my loved ones safe? Why did this happen? How long will this last?  Almost overnight, it seemed that every reporter, no matter their beat, was deputized as a health and science reporter, their minds suddenly occupied with concepts like virus transmission, PCR testing, social distancing, and vaccine development. During those frightening early days, weeks, and months, society turned to journalists to cut through confusion and misinformation and to cover stories that might save lives. The pandemic only highlighted what has always been true: Science journalism is an essential public service, informing communities about society’s most important issues, from climate to reproductive health to the explosion of AI. Yet we’ve created a world in which many reporters or editors think of “science journalism” as a distant relative of their own work. For too long, science journalism has been treated as something distinct, something  extra  — the domain of specialists writing for audiences who are already deeply interested in and informed about science. This is bad. It’s bad for journalism, and it’s bad for the audiences we serve. There was a time, a few decades ago, that some remember fondly as a science journalism heyday. Scores of newspapers had dedicated science, health, and environment desks. They featured weekly science sections. Magazines with “science” in their title peppered newsstands. The science beat (as well as employment and revenues) was thriving. But that period also perpetuated and deepened the perceived gulf between science journalism and the rest of journalism. It reinforced the inaccurate sense that covering science is and must always be the purview only of those journalists who made it their full-time calling, one that requires a deep background in biology, or astrophysics, or statistics. Distinctly, our industry viewed science coverage as  not  the purview of local journalists covering the city council, school board, or state legislature. It doesn’t have to be that way. We cannot afford to let it stay that way. Science journalism is a way of thinking, a journalistic practice rooted in evidence: how it is gathered, how it is verified, how it bumps up against communities’ realities. Science journalism means reporting on whether the city’s plan for remediating PFAS contamination in local waterways is likely to work or not. It means debunking misinformation about vaccines by explaining the methods behind vaccine trials and shining light on the devastation caused by vaccine-preventable diseases. It means exploring the connection between urban heat islands and increased crime rates and interrogating efforts to put cooling solutions in place. It means connecting public health and policy by examining the opioid crisis through both the science of addiction and investigative reporting into pharmaceutical companies’ marketing of addictive painkillers. In these ways and countless others, science is relevant to every aspect of journalism. It underpins nearly every story we care about. Climate change is not only a science story — it’s a story about infrastructure, migration, equity, and policy. AI is not just a technology story — it’s about labor, environmental resources, and governance. Public health isn’t just about disease outbreaks — it’s about housing, ecosystem decline, education, and systemic inequities. Siloing science journalism is dangerous because it leaves the public vulnerable to misinformation. It undermines journalism’s ability to put global crises into context and make them meaningful at the local level. It deprives people of the opportunity to appreciate the evidence surrounding the issues they care about. And it allows powerful actors — from corporations to politicians — to manipulate public understanding by filling the void left by a lack of evidence-based reporting. The newsrooms that succeed will be the ones embracing science as a thread that runs through every beat. This shift will require systemic changes. Less than 3% of reporters and editors in the U.S. — and even fewer elsewhere in the world — have formal training in covering science, health, or climate. But incorporating scientific evidence and perspectives into reporting is a learnable skill, one within the reach of any capable reporter. Managers will need to invest in giving their reporters that training. Reporters will need to build stronger connections to the scientific community, developing relationships with researchers who can offer insight and context. And editors will need to reframe how stories are assigned, ensuring that science isn’t confined to the “science, health, and environment” section (if there still is one) but integrated into all beats. Imagine a local newsroom where this approach is standard. A city hall reporter covering housing policy in a flood-prone area would weave in projections about rising sea levels and the disproportionate impact on low-income communities. A health reporter investigating maternal mortality would draw on research about systemic racism in healthcare. A political reporter covering legislation on artificial intelligence would unpack its implications for labor markets and privacy and energy usage. You’re already remembering stories you’ve read that fit the bill, aren’t you? What I’m talking about is not turning generalists into scientists, and it’s not about asking every journalist to master statistics. It’s about equipping reporters and editors with enough understanding to ask better questions, follow credible evidence, and reject false equivalency and hype. It’s also about recognizing that science is crucial to understanding the world. Integrating science more fully into journalism will not only serve readers — it will strengthen public trust in both science and in journalism itself. Audiences exposed to thoughtful, well-explained reporting about scientific evidence will be better equipped to discern credible journalism from misinformation. And in a time when misinformation thrives and even the very definition of a fact is up for grabs, building trust is journalism’s most urgent project. The challenges we face — from climate change to pandemics to the rapid acceleration of AI — are vast and interdependent. Covering them well requires curiosity, rigor, and humility. And it requires breaking down silos, not just between beats but between journalists and the communities they serve. In 2025, journalism will thrive not by doubling down on specialization but by recognizing that the methods and values of science journalism are essential to its future. The gulfs that divide us — between science and general reporting, between local and national and global issues, between journalists and their audiences — will diminish. And the best journalism will emerge from what grows in those in-between spaces.

  "prediction": "I’ve spent a lot of time over the past year surrounded by cancer patients. Also, being one. I was at the beginning of my journalism career when a  cancer diagnosis  knocked me off center. I’m in my early 20s, and none of my ailments are immediately obvious, which is why I’ve been adamant online and in public about  sharing my experience . Even before my diagnosis, I ran the gamut of symptoms that interfered with work: intense headaches, insomnia, wrist issues requiring occupational therapy, memory issues, and other problems. I could never bring myself to say, “Hey, I’m actually in a lot of pain. Can you go easy on me?” Journalism isn’t in the business of “easy.” If it was, we wouldn’t produce spotless breaking news, policy-changing investigations, and strong relationships with sources. It’s hard to find space for hiccups within that. That said, it’s not  new  news that journalism careers can feel unsustainable. People are burning out.  Layoffs  threaten livelihoods. Younger journalists are turning away from the trade, discouraged by the lack of work-life balance and the rocky media landscape. Online, journalists of color are  speaking out  about being driven from the industry. According to a  Muck Rack survey , more than half of journalists considered quitting in 2024. Heck, I even thought about switching to marketing. Journalists will push through a lot to get the job done. It’s the kind of people we are, the kind of people the industry attracts. And it can work. But only for so long. Even in good health, maintaining perfection gets exhausting. We’re  human . Add mental health issues, physical pain, caretaking responsibilities, or a combination of the three, and suddenly, a comma doesn’t seem like the most important thing in the world anymore. As the adage goes, balance is key. Journalistic excellence can exist alongside widening our tolerance for employees who might need a bit more grace. Therein lies the difference between equality and equity: in one, you push blanket standards onto your workforce in the hopes it’ll be enough — enough clicks, enough sources, enough time and energy spent on a project — and in the other you prove you care about your workforce by meeting individual needs where they need to be met. News isn’t dying , but it is changing. Widening accommodations is the biggest sign of this, whether that means offering work-from-home policies or other flexible arrangements. Legacy organizations want to fight this change. Organizations that want to make it to the future embrace it. Because the reality is your journalists don’t  have  to stick around. They can switch beats, outlets, industries. They can go to independent publishing platforms like Substack. Just as we turn from print to digital journalism, so too can we change our intolerance for so-called “weak” behavior to compassion and understanding. Every journalist has their own aches and pains. A standard for perfection in our work doesn’t need to translate to a standard for perfection in work ethic. Editing in layers exists for a reason. We are each meant to help one another, acting as a check and balance system, rather than penalizing each other for an off-day. No one should be punished for being sick — even if that sickness is not immediately clear. I could say all sorts of clichés to strengthen my argument, like “You never know what someone is going through” or “Kindness doesn’t cost anything” — but the retort “This is just the way we do it” will always exist. It reminds me of the phrase I heard in college: “There are no accommodations in real life.” But just because that’s how it’s done doesn’t mean it’s right. Also? There  are  accommodations in real life. The Americans with Disabilities Act is a wondrous thing. If you’re a journalist with a disability, I encourage you to look into it. You have the right to request  reasonable accommodations . The law  also  “restricts questions that can be asked about an applicant’s disability before a job offer is made,” according to the ADA’s website. You can find out more about whether or not you qualify  here . To employers I say, take the extra minute to wonder: What else might this person have going on in their life that’s impacting their performance, and how can I help them? To employees I say: As long as you feel safe, advocate for yourself, hold your overheads to clear communication and take a break when you need to. Accommodating employees is  so  in. Rachel S.

  "prediction": "In 2025, we won’t just read the news — we’ll talk to it, and it will talk back. News will transform from something we passively consume to something we actively experience through voice-first AI that turns text into conversation and readers into participants. I’m talking about unleashing the most powerful form of human communication — conversation — to revolutionize how we understand our world. The future of news is moving beyond the written word. With AI at its core, it’s conversational, spoken, interactive, responsive, and deeply personal — the very essence of meaningful human communication. Imagine sitting down with your morning coffee and saying, “Tell me what I need to know today.” Your AI companion doesn’t just read the headlines — it engages you in a personalized, conversational dialogue about the news that matters most to you. It understands your context, interests, and knowledge gaps. It can challenge your assumptions, present diverse perspectives, and guide you through complex topics with the patience and adaptability of a personal journalist. Curious about a complex geopolitical crisis? Don’t just read about it — discuss it. Want to unpack the implications of new economic policies, or explore stock market trends affecting your investments? Have a conversation about them. Interested in local issues? Engage in a dialogue that connects global trends to your neighborhood. This isn’t speculation — we’re on the cusp of this future. At  Newsroom Robots Labs , which I’m incubating at the Harvard Innovation Labs, our work focuses on demonstrating how newsrooms can incorporate conversational AI into their daily work, identifying practical use cases that enhance journalistic capabilities. Meanwhile, our product labs are reimagining how audiences could interact with information in entirely new ways, building conversational experiences that transform passive readers into active participants. The technological advancements of 2024 make this conversational future inevitable. Until recently, developers had to integrate multiple models to power speech-to-speech experiences, often sacrificing emotion and emphasis with noticeable latency, disrupting the natural flow of conversations. Now, with  OpenAI’s Realtime API , developers can create voice applications that capture the nuances of human conversation — all through a single API call. It even handles interruptions, as demonstrated by  ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode . Meanwhile,  Meta’s Spirit LM  represents another leap forward: an open-source multimodal language model that seamlessly integrates text and speech, enabling more expressive and fluid interactions across formats. Just this month, Eleven Labs introduced their own  conversational AI platform . It’s an all-in-one solution for creating customizable, interactive voice agents that manage turn-taking and interruptions with the fluidity of human conversation. Even more transformative advancements are on the horizon.  Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture , introduced this year, promises to revolutionize AI processing with a 2.5× performance boost over its predecessor. This next-generation GPU technology is set to power even more responsive and natural conversational AI applications. We’re already seeing audiences embrace this conversational approach. The popularity of  Google’s NotebookLM audio overviews  feature demonstrates the growing demand for AI-powered podcast-style discussions. Eleven Labs has now taken this further, integrating similar capabilities directly into their  Eleven Reader  mobile app, making conversational content creation accessible to anyone on the go. It’s plausible to predict the next evolution: These AI-powered discussions will move beyond one-way listening to real-time dialogue, where users can interrupt, ask questions, and engage in genuine conversation with the information itself. This will transform passive content consumption into dynamic, interactive understanding. The traditional model of journalism — write, publish, and hope readers understand — is fundamentally misaligned with how humans naturally process and engage with information. It’s even less aligned with how the younger generations consume content and the interactive, dynamic possibilities that AI enables for the future. Think about the last time you explained a complex topic to a friend. Did you write them an essay? Of course not. You had a conversation — responding to their questions, adjusting to their level of understanding, and building meaning together through discussion. This is how humans naturally learn and understand, yet we’ve confined ourselves to the straitjacket of one-way publishing simply because that’s what technology previously allowed. Now technology can finally match how humans naturally share information. It will transform how news fits into daily life for diverse audiences. For busy professionals, it delivers focused, interactive briefings that fit between meetings. For younger audiences, it provides dynamic discussions that match their preference for conversational engagement. For commuters, it offers rich audio experiences that turn traffic time into learning time. For students, it provides deeper context through adaptive, personalized insights that connect to their coursework. At the same time, it’ll break barriers for those traditionally underserved. For someone with visual impairments, it transforms news into a rich audio discussion. For a non-native speaker, it patiently explains unfamiliar terms. For someone overwhelmed by world events, it acts as a compassionate guide, helping them engage at their own pace. This isn’t just about convenience — it’s about meeting people where they are and making quality journalism truly accessible to everyone. This new technology presents both an opportunity and an imperative for news organizations to fundamentally reimagine their role. It’s no longer about adapting articles for voice interfaces. (That’s like early web publishers asking how to make their printed pages look good on screens.) Instead, it’s about designing systems that architect understanding through conversation. In this new era, the organizations that will dominate journalism will be those bold enough to rethink their entire approach to news delivery around conversation. They’ll replace static articles with “story spheres”: rich, multidimensional spaces of information that AI can navigate through dialogue. A breaking news story might begin with current developments but can seamlessly branch into historical context, expert analysis, or related global impacts based on the reader’s questions and interests. They’ll pioneer “narrative AI” capable of weaving complex stories into personalized, interactive conversations. And they’ll redefine the role of journalists, transforming them from writers into conversation architects who structure information for dynamic, AI-driven discovery. The entire concept of “publishing” will begin to evolve. Stories won’t be finished when they’re published; they’ll come alive through millions of unique conversations. Breaking news will no longer be about being first to print — it’ll be about facilitating the most meaningful, real-time dialogues as events unfold. The printing press democratized access to information. The internet democratized the ability to publish. The AI revolution will democratize understanding itself through the most human interface of all: conversation. The economic opportunities are staggering. Imagine monetizing not pageviews or subscriptions, but the depth and quality of AI-driven news conversations. Imagine offering premium access to specialized AI analysts for niche topics, where audiences pay for deeper, more personalized insights. Imagine news organizations transforming into centers of living knowledge, their AIs engaging millions in simultaneous, personalized dialogues — all while upholding rigorous editorial standards and fact-checking protocols. The future of news isn’t about reading words on screens. It’s about engaging in conversations that transform information into understanding, facts into insights, and observers into participants. It’s about making news as natural as conversation and as powerful as human curiosity. For newsrooms, 2025 is the year to be bold. To stop thinking about how to adapt existing formats to new technologies and instead start reimagining news as an ongoing, dynamic dialogue with humanity. To stop writing for readers and start designing for participants. To stop publishing articles and start architecting understanding. The tools are here. The technology has arrived. This is our moment to revolutionize how we deliver news and how humanity understands its own story. Nikita Roy  is the founder of  Newsroom Robots Labs . "

  "headline": "Covering Trump 2.0, now with less Trump",
  "summary": "“Every president claims a mandate and a decisive victory, but saying so doesn’t make it so. Media coverage is crucial for determining the scope of that power.”",
  "prediction": "In the spring of 2017, during the first 100 days of Donald Trump 1.0, I taught a class called Media and Policy Processes. We focused on the media’s role not only in covering policymaking, but also actively participating: helping government actors signal their positions and preferences to other policymakers, shifting and reflecting public opinion that influenced debates, and generally  “co-producing the news.”  I thought the first 100 days would be a useful framework for students to see how policy was shaped. Instead, we spent most class periods marveling at the ever-increasing number of anonymous sources powering behind-the-scenes process stories. By May, it wasn’t uncommon to see a reference to  30 anonymous sources  in a story about the tumult of Trumpworld in the West Wing. This was the heyday of the  “Trump Bump”  for national media, a heady time when Democrats’  trust in media  jumped twice as much as Republicans’ fell. For Trump 2.0, the media faces an important choice: more coverage of the person, or better coverage of the policy? I predict that in 2025, media will finally, against the odds, realize that these are not the same thing. Rather than take Trump’s rhetoric at face value, we can learn from political science that he’ll face many limitations. As with any incoming president, reporters and commentators can provide a valuable service by defining “the art of the possible” and helping voters understand the challenges that presidents face when trying to achieve their policy goals. The year will likely begin with a flurry of executive orders, signaling Trump’s priorities and carrying some immediate effects. Should these orders be covered as far-reaching, all-powerful edicts that allow Trump to project strength, or as regulatory guidance by an immediate lame duck? Scholarship on  presidential power  does not argue that strong presidents rely upon executive orders: presidential power is defined as the power to persuade, form a coalition, and pass policies with the power of Congress behind them. A president relying upon executive orders is a president who was unable to persuade lawmakers to codify his preferred positions — and will wield less influence as a result. Unified government will be both a hazard and a help for Trump 2.0. Message discipline is much easier for  the party out of power , and the incentives to criticize the president go up for their fellow partisans. As such, while policymaking may be easier with a “trifecta,” within-party criticisms become both more likely and more damaging to the president. Unlike divided government, where both parties can avoid responsibility for policy failures, unified government means Trump and the Republicans will own them in the lead-up to the midterms. Every president claims a mandate and a decisive victory, but saying so doesn’t make it so. Media coverage is crucial for determining the scope of that power. Instead of being reactive and credulous, I predict that the news audience is ready for a shift. The media will focus instead on informing the public about the limits of power, the policies the public can reasonably expect to pass, and how those policies will impact their lives. More of the same won’t cut it this time around. Joshua P. Darr  is an associate professor of communications at Syracuse University. "

  "prediction": "The narrative around the news business has felt static for years. We’re caught in the grips of an ongoing “mediapocalypse,” characterized by buyouts, layoffs, and shuttered newsrooms.  No one can deny that the environment is challenging. But the emphasis of the story too often obscures a trend that should be the source of real optimism: the rebirth of local news. My prediction, or at the very least my hope, is that in 2025 the new generation of thriving local news outlets will get the attention it deserves.  According to the Medill State of Local News Report, even amid the growing “news deserts,” we saw a net gain of over 80 standalone digital news outlets in 2024. All across the country, entrepreneurial and civic-minded outlets are reenergizing the local news business.   From my vantage point at the  American Journalism Project , I see local nonprofit news organizations that are changing the way we sustain local news, benefiting from a widening recognition that local news as a public good. They are building reliable income streams that combine philanthropy, sponsorship, and reader revenue. And they are making innovative use of digital tools to reach new audiences, rebuilding the bonds between communities and newsrooms.  These methods are working. In an industry often characterized as being in a permanent state of contraction, many nonprofit local news outlets are expanding. To highlight a few examples from among the American Journalism Project’s  partners , Signal Ohio, founded in 2021, launched Signal Cleveland that same year, expanded with Signal Akron in 2023, and this year unveiled its statewide bureau while announcing plans for Signal Cincinnati. The Texas Tribune, one of the standard-bearers for nonprofit news, this fall announced the creation of a network of community newsrooms, beginning in Waco. Cityside, a California nonprofit media organization, has in recent years debuted sites covering Oakland and, this year, Richmond. In the last year, AJP’s portfolio of grantees generated $86 million in revenue, up 36% from 2022, and they saw 58% median revenue growth. This growth is enabling more journalism, as our grantees increased editorial and newsroom staff by 18% over the last two years.  The list of accomplishments goes on, as do the accolades these new organizations are earning for their work. For the past two years, the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting has been awarded to a new nonprofit local newsroom. Mississippi Today, founded 2016, won in 2023 for their coverage of a $77 million dollar welfare scandal. This year, City Bureau and Invisible Institute in Chicago won for their coverage of police mishandling of missing person cases.  What the success of all these outlets underlines is that the public’s appetite for local news never went away, even as broader economic forces curtailed the supply. The American Journalism Project conducts surveys of residents across local media markets, asking them about their experiences with the news. Data from thousands of respondents  confirms  that, overwhelmingly, people value local news and appreciate the role it plays in fostering a deeper sense of community. This is in addition to the other benefits to local news that we’ve grown accustomed to hearing about in a negative framing: how the erosion of local reporting leads to increased political polarization, decreased voter registration, and so forth. The good news is we now have a foundation to reverse these impacts. None of this is to minimize the ongoing struggles in the larger media landscape, and in the news industry in particular. Yet these struggles are precisely why a model for sustainable, high-quality local news ought to be getting greater attention. There is a badly needed opportunity here for our business to attract and retain talent, to galvanize new supporters, and to scale proven practices.  There’s an old adage in the news business that journalists only cover the planes that crash. But in this case, we need to cover the planes that are taking off. A new generation of thriving local news outlets, doing journalism at the highest level: This is a story that needs to be told.  Sarabeth Berman  is CEO of the American Journalism Project. "

  "summary": "“Audiences are embracing human-curated content delivered through both digital and analog channels.”",
  "prediction": "During economic downturns, people seek small comforts to offset broader hardships — what Estée Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder dubbed the  “Lipstick Effect”  25 years ago. In 2025, I predict we’ll see a similar pattern in news consumption: an embrace of human-curated content as comfort food for our algorithm-weary minds. This comfort-seeking behavior parallels trends in the music industry. Despite Spotify’s launch in 2008 offering endless streaming options, vinyl sales began  climbing that same year . Today, while streaming services dominate the market,  vinyl accounts for nearly 10% of music revenue  — proof that consumers value curated, tactile experiences even when unlimited digital options exist. This hunger for human curation extends beyond music. From  hand-crafted zines  to community radio stations like the recently resurrected  East Village Radio , audiences are embracing human-curated content delivered through both digital and analog channels. Print media is finding new life too:  The Bitter Southerner’s thoughtfully crafted magazines  thrive in an age of infinite scroll, while digitally focused news startups like  The Macon Melody  discover that print editions attract both older, traditional readers, as well as younger ones who find  physical newspapers  as novel and authentic as their vinyl collections. Let’s be clear: Facebook, TikTok, and their algorithmic kin will continue to dominate how most people consume news, even as they continue to lose readers’ trust. But just as lipstick sales rise during recessions and vinyl thrives in the age of streaming, we’re about to witness what I call the Zine Effect. In 2025, watch for the rise of intimate news communities: locally-moderated WhatsApp groups where neighbors share and discuss community reporting, private newsletter collectives on platforms like  Letterloop  that combine human curation with reader dialogue, and yes, even printed periodicals making unexpected comebacks in college towns and urban neighborhoods. These won’t be mere rejection of algorithms and the enshittification of social media — they’ll be an embrace of something deeper. Like a cherished vinyl record or a hand-passed zine, human-curated news offers something algorithms can’t replicate: the comfort of knowing that on the other side of your news, there’s a person who cares about what you read, not just what keeps you scrolling.

  "summary": "“In a world where GenAI presents itself as the solution, we will return to the social sciences, Humanities, and even old-style journalism.”",
  "prediction": "In 2025 — and beyond — we will discover, once again, that the transformative new shiny gizmos we put to work in newsrooms are just the beginning of a long, continuous journey to improving journalism and society. In the past couple of years, newsrooms have been flooded with offers for new state-of-the-art software solutions that promise to fix various issues, increase productivity, augment reach, and beef up engagement. The advent of generative AI made its impact noticed in any type of work — news publishing included — and became one the most talked-about topics (see the  last year’s Nieman Lab Predictions ). In 2025, as we  domesticate  AI and learn how to incorporate these tools to fit our purposes and capabilities, we’ll discover that the skill to use tech is just the starting point: Tech is just one of the many tools at our disposal to accomplish our goals of social impact, alongside other strengths like market position, storytelling skills, political power, and relationships with our audience and with the people and entities that we cover. I’m no Luddite; if I were, I wouldn’t be teaching data journalism and the potential positive impact of AI in newsrooms. And I would have spent less time during my newsroom years telling people we should automate some of the stuff we did, like copying information off websites or cleaning up the same typos or style problems that came from the news wire. Technology can meet a lot of needs: How to be faster. How to have a prettier design. How to expand on what we can show to our readers. But while technology enables us to do things, it gives little explanation of  why  we should be doing things. So in 2025, as those shiny new toys start to feel the stress of day-to-day journalism, the old essential questions will continue to bedevil us: How do readers (now with their own lives thoroughly impacted by AI) understand, internalize, and act upon what they see in the news? What changes will our reporting and publishing affect society and the human experience? Are we writing about the things we should be writing about — not to satisfy some algorithmic platform out there, but to make our existence have meaning? How much longer will we be able to report on what we should be reporting, given economic, technological, and political forces? How do these forces converge to impact what we do? This has happened before. When search and social media emerged as news publishers’ primary sources of web traffic, the hype revolved around all the metrics that platforms could offer. With time, however, the race for raw audience reach lost its luster. Audience editors realized that having a large number was just part of the goal. The quality of that number — how engaged this audience was, how socially impactful the story was, and what readers would go on to do — those were the crucial things. That’s the deal with technology: The solutions it creates can be great, but they can also be solutions for things that aren’t actually problems — or aren’t the problems we should be caring about. The internet allows us to see how many minutes a user stays on a page, how that user scrolls up or down, or what they click on. What we should focus on, however, is what that reader (as a reader, not a user) is thinking about when they are scrolling through news outlets’ pages. Then, in 2016, at the peak of data journalism excitement and the hype around predictive polling, reality came to an industry that predicted a Hillary Clinton victory. In the post-mortem of that election,  some   commenters   criticized  election prediction in particular and data journalism in general. But what 2016 taught us was not that data and computation shouldn’t have a role in the news — it was that they are techniques that have limitations and have to be understood in the social context in which they are deployed. My old doctoral department at Northwestern University had a great mix of technologists and social scientists. That was the nature of the department, which focused on researching the interaction between technology and how we communicate. In that environment, it was always illuminating to see great scholars of computer science and engineering realize the limitations of their solutions simply due to human behavior. Users often do what we don’t expect, and the implications of our designs are usually only visible by having a broader, more critical view of social mechanisms. A motto emerged:  Social sciences are the hard sciences . In a world where AI presents itself as the solution, we will return to the social sciences, humanities, and even old-style journalism. Why? Because complex answers require complex questions and complex analysis. AI aggregates knowledge, and it does that relatively well. But we still have plenty of knowledge to  generate  about the human condition. In recent years, we’ve seen a dramatic  upswing in computer science programs , motivated by the tech industry’s encroachment into everything. But with AI helping us code, demand for actual hard coders will subside. Computer science education is adjusting to the new times by  increasing the focus on abstraction in its curriculum . Futurists are pointing to  the importance of the humanities  in a new tech-heavy but code-light world. Even in the  boldest dreams about AI and journalism integration , it’s clear that market forces and human behavior will drive success, not technology alone. The new wave in journalism will not be what we can take from technologists to improve our industry; it is what journalism can do to shape these technologies and how we can go beyond them.

  "prediction": "It’s Thanksgiving Day, 2022.  Nearly everyone in the U.S.  is commemorating the holiday. Most are gathering with friends and family, some for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic, combatting a rising epidemic of loneliness and alienation plaguing every community in the country. When they turn on NPR’s  morning news roundup , they’re greeted by the host’s very first words: “Some families will have an empty seat at their Thanksgiving tables today, including those who lost loved ones in the mass shooting at a Virginia Walmart this week. Who are the victims? And what were their last moments like?” Sensationalism has been a cornerstone of the U.S. news media since the late 19th century, when journalism industry patriarchs William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer built empires by prioritizing attention-grabbing news, increasing the value of newspapers to advertisers instead of subscribers. They went on to become some of the wealthiest people of the time. Metropolitan and regional newspapers followed Hearst and Pulitzer’s leads before the U.S. news industry began to conform to professional standards like “objectivity” to appeal to the broad audiences that attract advertisers. More than a century later, U.S. news media continues to be driven by a culture of attention-seeking breaking news, combative investigations, and beat reporting primarily focused on deficits and conflict. “If it bleeds, it leads” is often true, even in publicly funded newsrooms or those that label themselves a “public service.” Breaking news and deficit-centered reporting can be useful, but it largely fails to address the social-emotional needs of communities, including things like helping people develop healthy identities, build supportive relationships, set and achieve goals, and make empathetic, thoughtful decisions. That’s why a new standard for journalism is emerging: journalism as a social service. At  The Jersey Bee , we’re early entrants into this field, building technology and systems to use journalism to solve problems in our commitment to modeling local news as a public utility through its sister project,  Info Districts . The Jersey Bee follows a  theory of change  that focuses on improving public health outcomes and building capacity for civic engagement in our community. In an audience survey, 75% of respondents said they take civic actions as a result of our reporting — actions like voting or volunteering, meeting someone new, attending a community meeting, or accessing aid and resources. The Jersey Bee’s virtual reference desk is an intake form for community members with specific questions. Info needs surveys, ecosystem mapping, and community engagement inform what we report. Collaborations allow us to partner with social service providers to ensure we can direct people where they need to go and provide reporting on issues that matter to the people we serve. We reach people through newsletters, social media, a website, a calendar, zines, text messages, events, canvassing, and trainings. We then use those channels to ask people what they want to know. So, the cycle continues. Journalism as a social service is about helping people and communities become the best versions of themselves. That’s something another 100 years of Pulitzer Prizes will not achieve. But that is what people helped by your journalism will value.

  "headline": "A renewed appetite for print",
  "summary": "“The printed page offers our minds a break from those hits of dopamine that distracted us from thinking, feeling, and doing more important things.”",
  "prediction": "In August, I canceled my weekend delivery of a print newspaper. By November, I’d resubscribed, longing for something I missed most during the pandemic: serendipity. This past Saturday, while leafing through The New York Times, I learned that Kim Deal, former bassist of the Pixies,  lives in Dayton, Ohio . I stumbled upon an article about the deadly challenges  many Kenyan female athletes face . And I read about Putin’s  deepening quandaries  nearly three years into the war in Ukraine. These were stories I hadn’t sought out but encountered by simply spreading open the printed pages — a stark contrast to algorithm-driven digital feeds that know exactly what pulls me into the rabbit hole. Ladina Heimgartner, the CEO of Ringier Media Switzerland, said at the WAN-IFRA Congress in Copenhagen recently that print is the new luxury, a symbol of leisure and remedy to the daily digital grind. I predict that in 2025, people will have a renewed appetite for print publications and decentralized social platforms. Algorithm-driven feeds feel like work and are often filled with a false sense of urgency, manipulation, and relentless sales tactics. The printed page offers our minds a break from those hits of dopamine that distracted us from thinking, feeling, and doing more important things. The Onion, sensing that people’s media diets are changing,  has reinstituted  a monthly print edition after 10 years of being digital only. Changes to online algorithms  are promised by incoming FCC chair Brendan Carr, challenging perceived left-leaning algorithmic biases and potentially reshaping how social platforms function. But public irritation of feeling manipulated by algorithms may also push people toward platforms that offer more digital autonomy, like Bluesky and Mastodon, where you can adjust who you see and as it is posted. Constant connectivity hasn’t fundamentally changed our understanding of the world or outcomes of events. Sometimes, what’s truly needed is a “week in review” to better understand the bigger picture. This isn’t about disconnecting from news — it’s about creating healthier boundaries that let us focus beyond the latest grievance. The coming year will prioritize focus over immediacy. Serendipity in print and on decentralized digital platforms will return and may just bring sweet relief from an algorithm-saturated world.

  "summary": "“For news organizations looking to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, exploring these platforms isn’t just about finding new distribution channels – it’s about building the foundation for future AI-powered news experiences.”",
  "prediction": "The decision by the European Federation of Journalists, the largest such organization in Europe, to  stop posting on Twitter  as of January 20, 2025, signals a broader media shift towards social media and news sharing alternatives. “The EFJ considers that it can no longer ethically participate in a social network that its owner has transformed into a machine of disinformation and propaganda,” the group  wrote  when announcing the decision. The site that many journalists are gravitating towards, currently, is  Bluesky . But Bluesky is just the beginning. Journalists are experimenting with WhatsApp, Discord, and several other engagement tools. In some sense, this reminds me a bit of the beginning era of social media, when there was no unified place where journalists had decided they would all be. In addition to a general mistrust and stronger skepticism of the altruism of big tech and social media, another major difference between the early 2000s and now is that these tools aren’t just for sharing links, but they also allow for broader experimentation and digital growth. At KQED, we have already demonstrated how this dual approach can work, using platforms like Discord to both engage audiences and build AI-powered content discovery tools. KQED’s experience with our Forum program shows how  Discord’s real-time discussion features and multimedia sharing capabilities create vibrant community spaces . But the platform offers more than just engagement — it provides structured data that can inform AI development. That’s the key here — working in these platforms isn’t just about the short-term platform engagement work itself. It’s also about encouraging and building sandboxes for news organizations to experiment in some of the AI tools that will be important for the future. Bluesky represents another frontier in this evolution. Its decentralized protocol offers news organizations unprecedented control over their data and audience relationships. Unlike traditional social platforms, the platform’s transparency helps news organizations maintain editorial integrity while experimenting with AI tools. Imagine a tool that uses natural language processing to identify emerging community issues on Bluesky before they become major news stories, or a tools that integrates directly into Bluesky’s decentralized protocol to help newsrooms share relevant archival content when related topics trend. WhatsApp, meanwhile, offers a more intimate connection with audiences. Many newsrooms have already launched WhatsApp channels to deliver personalized news updates, but more potential lies in using these interactions to build smarter AI tools like chatbots. For news organizations looking to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, exploring these platforms isn’t just about finding new distribution channels — it’s about building the foundation for future AI-powered news experiences. The organizations that start experimenting now will be better positioned to understand and serve their audiences in the years ahead. Ethan Toven-Lindsey  is vice president of news at KQED. "

  "summary": "“Physical deterioration, outdated formats, publications disappearing, and the relentless advance of technology leave archives vulnerable.”",
  "prediction": "As journalists, authors, and photographers, our work shapes how history remembers the world. But in 2025, the fight to preserve this work feels more urgent than ever. Digital fragility and denialism threaten to erode the integrity of our stories, making preservation a moral imperative. Decades of photojournalism, often captured under the most challenging conditions, are at risk of being lost to time. Physical deterioration, outdated formats, publications disappearing, and the relentless advance of technology leave archives vulnerable. Worse, the rise of misinformation and digital manipulation has created a world where the authenticity of images can no longer be taken for granted. The hurdles faced today have sparked a strong push among journalists and photojournalists to safeguard their work for future generations. Embracing cutting-edge technologies to shield their archives from loss or manipulation, some are turning to decentralized storage solutions and  cryptographic verification tools . Fully aware that  digitization is but one step towards actual preservation , these efforts go beyond safeguarding files — they aim to preserve the integrity and context of the stories they tell. The loss of an archive is a tragedy not only for the creator but for the communities their work represents. Entire histories risk being forgotten, misrepresented, or erased, creating “ history deserts .” Preservation is not just about keeping the past alive; it’s also about ensuring future generations can access reliable, untampered documentation of our world. In 2025, we must act decisively. The question isn’t whether our stories will survive, but whether they’ll survive intact — and whether the truth they carry will endure in the face of new challenges. By embracing preservation as a shared responsibility, we can ensure that the work of journalists and photographers continues to illuminate the past, shape the present, and inform the future.

  "summary": "“Instead of rewarding these things with fair pay, job security and moral support, journalism as an industry exploits their love of the craft.”",
  "prediction": "Journalism should be the greatest job in the world, but for many journalists — even at top news outlets — it isn’t. Even the best journalists have to worry about layoffs, changes in ownership, stagnant pay and the life sacrifices the job often requires. Freeing four wrongfully convicted people from prison with her reporting wasn’t enough to get my former colleague Michelle Mondo a raise at her local newspaper. If that isn’t the kind of journalism that should be celebrated and rewarded, what is? At the time, she was making $45,000 a year. That was in 2010 and with a decade of experience. Now she’s a private investigator. She owns her own company, Mondo Investigations, and can easily earn double that amount in a fraction of the time while enjoying a better quality of life. Another former colleague left journalism for law school and became an immigration attorney. At least one former colleague joined the Foreign Service. A friend with a very good managerial journalism job said they wouldn’t hesitate to look outside the industry should their role evaporate or the job becomes untenable. There comes a point where the tradeoffs just aren’t worth it. There are plenty of ways to do meaningful work in this world, and there are plenty of ways to practice journalism outside of full-time news jobs. Journalists pour their hearts and souls into the job. They fight for justice and often sacrifice parts of themselves in the process. They report from war zones so atrocities can’t be pushed aside and forgotten so easily. They investigate exorbitant medical bills and incorrect water and property tax bills, helping readers and viewers keep their homes and avoid a lifetime of debt. They bravely go into protests expecting to be pepper sprayed. They wake up in the middle of the night to cover mass shootings and compassionately interview victims’ families while their own families wait patiently for them at home. Instead of rewarding these things with fair pay, job security, and moral support, journalism as an industry exploits their love of the craft. Nothing seems to be enough to prevent a layoff, warrant a raise, or get health insurance with robust mental health benefits. Even Pulitzer Prize winners aren’t immune from losing their jobs. As long as I’ve been in journalism, we’ve been told we should feel lucky to have jobs, even if they don’t pay enough to live in the expensive cities they require us to move to. We’ve been told to get second jobs if we need to, keep our personal feelings to ourselves on social media and keep quiet about things we would investigate were they happening at other companies. What we should get is fair pay for our work, robust benefits, time off to recharge from what can be a grueling job and the psychological safety to dissent. Journalists love the work and serving their communities. As long as journalism continues to take advantage of that, the kinds of journalists newsrooms need most are going to keep moving on, even from places that once looked like the home of dream jobs.

  "summary": "“We’re in a cultural moment that, quite positively, is marked by an enhanced focus on mental health and openly confronting personal struggles. News can be too much.”",
  "prediction": "Years of year-end predictions reveal a journalism industry battered about by change. Past predictions chronicle the bumpy adaptation to economic precarity, unstable alliances with platforms, so many technology innovations, real physical threats, and a host of other developments that are often challenges and sometimes opportunities. These topics are all important and worthy of our attention, but we also need to step back and take a broader look at the state of journalism not as an industry or a practice but as part of public life. To put it drastically: Will 2025 mark a tipping point in which wide swathes of people are really done with news? I’m opening myself up to accusations of overstatement, especially in raising this question on a website dedicated to journalism read by people similarly dedicated to journalism. I am not predicting the widespread demise of journalism over the next twelve months. Rather, I want to point to a more mundane phenomenon where news becomes less important and news consumption less ritualized for larger numbers of people — including many who read this site. This isn’t a new development, as the growing literature on news avoidance continues to show. Past news consumption is certainly overestimated, particularly when there were fewer other options. But my concerns are not merely about the technological availability of diverse content crowding out news. After all, there has remained a cultural narrative that news is good and we ought to be informing ourselves as part of being good citizens and community members. In 2025, I predict we’ll see a further erosion of this collective belief, affecting not only how we  use  news but how we  think about  news. These questions are top of mind for me as I spend my research time thinking about the idea of “news discouragement” — the ways in which we are told that we should avoid certain types of news or that the ways in which we don’t use news come to be seen as justified and right. Donald Trump echoed and amplified a long-running right-wing critique of journalism as politically biased, raising its status to that of an enemy, and encouraging supporters to seek alternative paths for information (including his own social media platform). These critiques are not about individual stories or journalists, but about institutional corruption that renders all news suspect. We cannot dismiss such sentiments are marginal; surveys show that they are widely held. But there are other forms of news discouragement we need to pay attention to — including something far more ordinary about tuning out the news as a way of centering our individual wellbeing. We understand that what makes news news is often its tragic element: crime, war, destruction, death. Add to this the pain of watching a political regime that one opposes and the news becomes unbearable. At the same time, we’re in a cultural moment that, quite positively, is marked by an enhanced focus on mental health and openly confronting personal struggles. News can be too much. It could be that Trump’s reelection sparks a journalistic renaissance, echoing the parade of quality investigative journalism that emerged during his first term. It could be we rely on journalists more than ever when faced with threats of democratic backsliding. It could be that journalism provides some semblance of solidarity. But it could also be that, for many, 2025 marks a receding of news from our consciousness as a way of coping with deeply felt confusion and fear. Instead of engaging in endless updates and doomscrolling, we may instead turn inward, away from news. If this is the case, the implications go far beyond what this means for the news industry to instead question the state of our collective sensemaking as we face the unknown.

  "summary": "“Technology will finally help journalists give their audience members a better version of the news article, one which favors understanding, not just informing.”",
  "prediction": "The typical inverted-pyramid news article is like airplane food — edible but to no one’s taste. Since its inception in the 1800s, the story format is a functional, practical way to organize information in the absence of any knowledge about what the members of their audience want and need. But in 2025, we can know our audience and tell stories for each member. Now, we can treat articles as collections of discrete pieces of information. The facts, quotes, and background references are stored individually and assembled (and reassembled) in many “articles” to serve the individual audience members. Creating understanding, not simply informing, should be the goal of every journalist. In 2025, journalism must build a new generation of knowledge management tools. These tools treat individual information as a customer relationship management system treats sales contacts. They will store new sources, facts, and connections between them. They will also record the provenance of each piece of information. Reporters and editors should offer their perspectives on essential facts and concepts. Fluid stories can be assembled — instead of the old, imperfect, immutable story we are used to. These “living” stories can adapt and recreate themselves. When a reader selects a story, the length, depth, format or complexity can be changed as they read it. New information is instantly incorporated. A user’s scroll speed while reading will trigger the system to change the complexity of the language — making it more straightforward if needed. Prior reading history might suggest a reader needs more (or less) background information. Tracking may show a reader is more or less likely to click on audio or video information, suggesting new formats for the story. It’s not enough to tell readers a fact or to share a quote. The goal of journalism must be to ensure that each reader truly comprehends and can act upon what they learn. Generative AI will help us assemble and reassemble these stories to meet the needs of our audience members. Technology will finally help journalists give their audience members a better version of the news article, one which favors understanding, not just informing. This new approach will help journalism transition from a one-to-many model to a one-to-one-for-many model. The monolithic, canonical article had value, but it was primarily economic: Spend as little as possible to create the article. Show it to as many people as possible. Hopefully, those people will view advertising, purchase subscriptions, or pay for merch. Audience satisfaction had little economic value, so media organizations needed more incentive to improve storytelling.

  "summary": "“The Rogans and Coopers of the world will float in their opulent pools while the rest of us fight for greedy sips of what’s left.”",
  "prediction": "During the podcasting gold rush of the 2010s, the industry saw an injection of capital into its middle class: the creators who did this work professionally but who weren’t multimillionaires, those whose success was modest, not explosive. The podcast middle class is a range of shows operating in the $100,000 to $500,000 budget range, which have audiences that are large enough to sell ads against but aren’t generally topping charts or breaking the internet. During this time, craft was a priority and teams of producers, editors, and engineers collaborated on work that experimented with the medium.  It’s important to resist the urge to be too nostalgic. This era was as much a cynical land grab from businesses importing Silicon Valley brain-rot priorities to a fledgling media space as it was a halcyon time for expansion and experimentation. These middle-class shows were seen as viable investments, in part, because they cultivated IP for potential licensing deals. Everyone wanted their own Serial, their own Missing Richard Simmons, their own Dr. Death, and hundreds of jobs were created for producers in that pursuit.  The audio industry has consolidated in recent years, and it’s harder than ever to fund these middle class shows. Platforms like YouTube and Spotify are incentivizing creators to incorporate video into their podcasts, a move that will likely result in more shows with lower production value, and budget dollars going toward video production rather than robust editorial teams.  Taking a chance on ambitious shows with moderate budgets will become less common. With deals like Wondery’s $100 million New Heights distribution deal and SiriusXM’s $125 million deal for Call Her Daddy setting precedents, the biggest networks will continue to stoke the fires of the shows with the largest audiences. These shows will continue to network-hop, eating up increasingly lucrative deals while podcasts from household names will be bootstrapped or produced at a loss by creators with increasingly precarious positions in the industry.  The most optimistic read on this is that the big shows — the one percenters — will entice advertisers to buy spots across networks, a trickle-down economics for the podcast middle class. But has that prosperity ever actually trickled downstream? More likely: The Rogans and Coopers of the world will float in their opulent pools while the rest of us fight for greedy sips of what’s left.

  "summary": "“We must rise to this challenge with Kendrick-like precision: thoughtful, impactful, and unapologetic. Writing — our craft’s core — must be sharper, richer, and distinctive.”",
  "prediction": "This year could define the future of journalism — our Kendrick Lamar year. We are classically trained to serve and defend democracy, and now we must deliver unmatched, impactful work that reclaims our place as  the Fourth Estate . The influencers, haters, and imitators? They’re not like us. But the threats are real. Technology has disrupted our industry, disinformation infects public discourse, and news consumption habits have shifted. Add a challenging advertising climate and  costly lawsuits targeting truth-tellers , and this era is not just about survival — it’s about renewal. Journalism must redefine its purpose and reconnect with audiences, particularly local communities. Our role has never been more vital. We must rise to this challenge with Kendrick-like precision: thoughtful, impactful, and unapologetic. Writing — our craft’s core — must be sharper, richer, and distinctive. Newsrooms need to drop blinders, stop creating content for echo chambers, and focus on serving  the people . Our past work cannot carry us forward — we need action. The media landscape  has transformed . Social media influencers and podcasters dominate  political discourse , while Elon Musk stakes his claim for X to over 106 million people, declaring  “You are the media now.” No. It’s still us — but it’s time to dig deep. Return to the lab, step into the booth, and show everyone our hunger. Just as streaming disrupted the music industry, digital shifts and AI force journalism to rethink its relationship with audiences. Only those who stay authentic and innovative will rise above the noise. The 2024 election showed that  polls remain flawed , and talking heads often miss the ground truth. Journalism’s future isn’t about thought pieces that win praise in journalistic circles — it’s about delivering  what communities need . Nontraditional outlets like The Joe Rogan Experience and The Breakfast Club  became go-to platforms  during the election. If your phone didn’t ring, it’s a clear signal: You’re no longer the gateway to millions. Since 2005, the U.S. has lost  one-third of its newspapers  and  two-thirds of its journalists . Misinformation has rushed into this vacuum, leaving communities vulnerable and the media  struggling to adapt . Trust in journalism is at an all-time low. Gallup reports  only 31% of Americans trust the media , while “pink slime” journalism — sites spreading computer-generated disinformation disguised as news — thrives.  Kate Starbird’s research  highlights how misinformation thrives by exploiting collective sensemaking, muddying discourse, and  distorting public perception . These pressures will test journalism’s craft, integrity, and resolve. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Social media fragments audiences, siphons traffic, and  buries trusted reporting  in algorithms. As a revenue executive in media recently remarked,  our industry  is “in the middle of a knife fight in a phone booth.” Sit in that. Some won’t make it, and others won’t heed the call. But rebuilding trust starts with reinvesting in local journalism. It’s not just aspirational—it’s actionable. Pockets of excellence show the way forward. Accurate, deeply reported stories cut through the noise. Fact-checking, investigative work, and audience engagement are critical to combating disinformation. This is the time to prioritize community trust and factual accuracy, using subject matter expertise — and tools like Smart Brevity — to distill complexity without losing depth. Newsletters offer direct connections to audiences, and AI can enhance reporting by analyzing datasets. Newsrooms must reduce reliance on third-party algorithms and build loyal audiences on their platforms. The industry must redefine its relationship with technology, creating new tools that empower journalists and audiences. Journalism needs to cultivate an insatiable appetite for the work only we can do. Now is the time to act boldly, innovate fearlessly, and serve all communities — not just the ones decision-makers know. The hunger for news hasn’t disappeared — it’s waiting to be fed with integrity, vision, and courage. Kendrick reminds us that authenticity and quality always rise above. Journalism must do the same — set the standard, own the future, and leave no doubt about who still defines the game. Delano Massey  is managing editor of Axios Local. "

  "prediction": "In 2025, attacks on journalists are set to escalate. A disturbing global trend continues to expand: the use of criminal law to silence journalists. This tactic, perfected by authoritarian regimes in places like Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, China, and the Philippines, is now spreading worldwide. Even in the United States, a Kansas newsroom faced such tactics in 2023. According to the  2024 World Press Freedom Index  from Reporters Without Borders, political authorities, who should protect freedom of the press, are instead weaponizing their judiciaries to criminalize journalism.  The Committee to Protect Journalists reports  that, as of December 1, 2023, 320 journalists were imprisoned — a stark reminder of this growing threat. The repressive-regime handbook now includes tactics like SLAPPs (strategic lawsuits against public participation), financial pressure, and social media harassment. Still, the most concerning tactic is the weaponization of criminal law, leading to journalists’ imprisonment, financial ruin, and loss of civil rights. This not only silences dissent but also forces many journalists into exile, as seen with Nicaragua’s  Confidencial  and El Salvador’s  El Faro . In response, newsrooms are evolving. In 2025, they will prioritize building  local  and  regional support networks ,  enhancing digital security , and looking for  support in legal defense . New  protocols , emergency funds for relocation, and reporting from abroad. Collaborations like  #NoNosCallarán  in Guatemala demonstrates the power of collective defense. Tools like the  U.S. Press Freedom Tracker  and the  U.S. State of Press Freedom Index  will continue to be crucial in safeguarding journalism.  As threats evolve, so must the strategies to protect the free press — a cornerstone of democracy. Jose Zamora  is a journalist and communications advisor. "

  "summary": "“Journalists risk losing their audiences through enactments of authenticity that, at their core, may be perceived less as genuine humanness and more as illusory performance.”",
  "prediction": "Rather than focus on authenticity, media organizations will double down on journalists’ humanness in its many forms. Theorists have long lamented the lionization of an authentic self, decrying authenticity as a mirage, an illusive social construct, a pursuit of expectations rather than genuineness, and a  trap of stereotypes  that, when chased, can promote an individualistic approach and a  loss of shared meaning . Authenticity — as journalists seek to perform their authentic selves — has been tagged as a journalistic necessity for audience engagement and market-driven goals, a means for journalists to set themselves apart from content driven by  artificial intelligence , and a way of reckoning with distrust in the news. But authenticity is rarely clearly defined. Instead, it’s offered as a mystical salve to many of journalism’s recent challenges. Just as audiences have begun turning away from some social media influencers because of their lack of genuine connections, so do journalists risk losing their audiences through enactments of authenticity that, at their core, may be perceived less as genuine humanness and more as illusory performance. As we look ahead to 2025, we see journalism shaking off the problematic nature of authenticity and leaning more into  humanness . This means going beyond data trends and providing a nuanced picture of people’s motivations and emotions while embracing, if not promoting, deeper forms of self-expression. While not a static concept, humanness as a value allows journalists to address audience calls for deeper connections while helping media organizations acknowledge and promote the  human side of their journalists . As journalists wrestle with calls to perform more authentically in digital spaces, they face mounting precarities in such spaces. These  hazards  — including escalations in harassment and threats of physical and sexual violence — highlight the need to remember the humans doing journalism and their many unique complexities. News audiences have already begun  moving away  from acts of authenticity, citing them as performative, marginalizing, and tokenizing. Authenticity has also  been shown  to give leverage to micro-celebrities and pseudo-journalists on social media seeking to spread disinformation. Authenticity has been relational and rarely supportive of journalism. Our collaborative research  on  wellbeing in the workplace  similarly points to other issues for journalists. Journalists, especially those doing visible work with particular positionalities, can limit their realness or authenticity due to the constant attacks on the profession and their identity. Journalists may alter their experiences, or even their content, to shield themselves from abuse. They may also disconnect from social media practices to find some sense of realness. Or they may change their sense of self to connect to a particular set of audiences, performing to different norms across different platforms. Humanness as a value for journalism is a powerful organizational framework to acknowledge journalists as complex people with different lived experiences who strive to conduct strong ethical and accurate reporting.  As our evidenced-based research shows , different types of organizational intervention can support this framework — from systemic support infrastructures, training, and awareness, risk management, specialized support for high-risk reporting, and workflow considerations, to workplace culture change and wellness programs. Humanness will remain difficult for a  fractured media culture  that values speed, sensationalism, click and engagement, and simplistic narratives. But considering how journalism values itself through humanness will only benefit the news in 2025. Journalism already adopts many of these principles. But as we take stock of 2024 and look ahead to 2025, humanness for news leadership will provide a powerful framework for an industry that seeks to listen carefully, report accurately, and demonstrate the importance of humanness in news.

The story goes like this: People distrust the news because they don’t know how it gets made, which leads to inaccurate assumptions about journalists’ motivations and practices. So if journalists want to improve people’s trust in news, they need to  show  people how they  go about their reporting , and  why  their stories come out the way that they do. This argument has its  challengers , but maintains its appealing for two reasons. It’s straightforward, and it suggests journalists hold a great deal of influence over how people feel about their work. What this approach doesn’t consider, however, is something that journalists will finally reckon with in 2025: that people are skeptical of news because they believe journalists prioritize profits above truth or public service. Those working in journalism might think this idea is crazy. The news industry’s economics have been  dismal  for decades. Why would people suspect journalists of putting profits over the public in a profession that is known for having so little profit to go around in the first place? Yet a  study  I recently co-authored with Seth Lewis and Brent Cowley that drew on in-depth interviews with adults representing a cross-section of age, political leaning, socioeconomic status, and gender found that people’s distrust in news do not stem from assumptions that journalists are hopelessly biased or incompetent. Instead, they believe that news organizations report the news inaccurately because they simply want to generate larger audiences — and therefore larger profits. As one interviewee told us, “It’s profits over journalism and over truth.” Another said of subscriptions to news organizations,  “They get you to pay for that and — poof — you’re a sucker.” In 2025, journalists will acknowledge that people’s skepticism toward news is fundamentally tied up in their unflattering misunderstandings about how journalists — and the organizations they work for — make money. Journalism stakeholders will need to grapple with this gap between the reality and perception when it comes to how money shapes journalism if they want to begin to meaningfully tackle journalism’s growing trust problem. Just as journalists learned to overcome their initial reservations about showing the public how their news gets produced, they will once again learn to get over themselves enough so that they can show the public how their news gets paid for. This means newsrooms managers will  share more about their funding , journalists will  share more about their salaries , and employees on both sides of the “firewall” between business and editorial will  publicly  grapple with the ways they attempt to maintain that firewall and the extent to which it actually exists. A good place to start would be a simple explainer for audiences that guides them through what a “firewall” even means in the first place. Nonprofit newsrooms have been  especially open  when it comes to sharing the relationship between their business models and their approach to their audiences. They’re charting a path that for-profit newsrooms will hopefully follow. “We don’t talk about how money influences our journalism,”  wrote  Trusting News executive director Joy Mayer a few months ago. In 2025, we will. Jacob L. Nelson  is an associate professor at the University of Utah. "

  "summary": "“When journalists around the world are being killed for practicing their freedom of press, journalists have no choice but to become activists.”",
  "prediction": "There is a growing frustration in the pit of the global journalism industry’s stomach. A frustration that comes from witnessing an entire year of devastating war in the Middle East, massive bloodshed, and ongoing conflicts across the globe where nothing seems to be working. A sickening frustration fed by the reeking hypocrisy of trying to “holding truth to power” in a post-truth world simultaneously bowing to power. This frustration was born long ago in the stomachs of marginalized members of various diasporas, like myself, coming from histories of ancestral displacement and ravaging colonialism, and it is in part what has motivated them to join media and journalism industries only to be met with walls of supposed  objectivity . An “impartiality” that leads to donning a hollow mask of white neutrality discordant with their lived realities. That frustration will come to a breaking point in 2025 and translate into tearing down the line between activism and journalism that has already been  breached , particularly since the 2020 rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. When democracies are in peril, when international laws meant to hold humanity accountable are being disregarded, when people charged with criminal offenses are leading governments, when journalists around the world are being killed for practicing their freedom of press, journalists have no choice but to become activists. In 2025, journalists will no longer be told that coming in to work with a “Free Palestine” sticker on their laptops or water bottles is controversial and against guidelines while a “Stand With Ukraine” sticker is praised. Massive refugee and humanitarian displacements that occurred in 2024 will also impact news audiences. As journalists respond to audience demands, this shift will encourage a journalistic focus on human interest and global perspective stories that amplify refugee and diaspora narratives. Diaspora communities will play a crucial role in shaping these narratives through activism and storytelling that will bloom in the 2025 media and journalism industry. When giving a lecture on media framing at the University of British Columbia in 2022, I held a roundtable attended by many members of Palestinian diaspora in Canada. Every one of them expressed turning away from legacy media in favor of citizen journalism and treating activists as sources for news. What if journalists with training and established platforms could tap into these audiences who are rejecting them in favor of unofficial news sources? What does this rejection mean for the decline of legacy media and journalistic ethics of “truth-telling?” The answers to these questions, I predict, will come to fruition in 2025. We, as an industry, will have to reevaluate the meaning of “journalistic independence” if we want that sickening pit of frustration to heal. And the demands of a growing diaspora born out of conflict, war, and displacement will be one exceedingly difficult to ignore.

  "summary": "“No one magic button, but many small magical buttons.”",
  "prediction": "Many newsrooms and publishers are looking for ways to use generative AI, and they’re making one crucial mistake: They’re hoping for the one magic button. They’re hoping for AI that can quickly turn an article into a podcast, web story, or newsletter. For AI that can quickly add illustrations to a product. For AI that allows untrained users to deliver results at the push of a button, within seconds. That’s just not how it works (at least for now). Anyone who works directly and hands-on with AI will be able to confirm: In its current version, AI can help professionals with parts of processes. It can deliver first drafts, sometimes even spectacularly good ones, but it needs experts to work with the outputs. An audio professional can create a good podcast faster with AI’s help. Because AI assists with rewriting and production. Someone who has written a text can create social media posts with the help of AI. The reverse is more difficult — if someone who doesn’t know the article uses AI to create social media posts, they need to compare the original and the output — and at that point, they might as well do everything themselves. A designer can develop an illustration style using AI and then generate hundreds of images and use a dozen of them. But it requires the practiced and trained eye; it requires art direction. This is not for novices. For this to work, AI must be considered from the start, not at the end of a process. Otherwise, we’ll continue building our conventional processes and miss the opportunities that AI undoubtedly offers. This means examining all workflows carefully. It also means staying realistic. Otherwise, disappointment is high when the automatically translated podcast needs a lot of post-production because the translations aren’t quite right, because timelines slip, or because the computer voice glitches. Or when a designer sees poor computer-generated images and despairs. A professional has the knowledge and tools to still achieve good results quickly. Everyone else will get frustrated. In 2025, we need to consider AI from the start. Carefully examine all steps. This is where the opportunities lie. No one magic button, but many small magical buttons.

  "summary": "“As AI-generated content becomes ubiquitous, the qualities that define human writing — authenticity, emotional depth, and creative intuition — will become even more critical, ensuring that a writer’s presence is felt throughout a narrative.”",
  "prediction": "Odds are artificial intelligence will feature prominently in many of Nieman Lab’s predictions for journalism in the coming year. I predict that editors in newsrooms worldwide will find themselves navigating two concurrent revolutions: mobile-first and AI. Unlike previous changes the media has encountered, these transformations fundamentally affect the craft of journalism itself — specifically, how content is created and experienced. With mobile-first comes the necessity of mobile storytelling, a method that emphasizes the seamless integration of text and visual assets in a vertical, scrolling format. This approach calls for writers to interweave their text with visuals, challenging the traditional journalistic style of uninterrupted text. Rather than directing readers to view photos or videos separately from the written narrative, mobile storytelling invites readers to experience text, photos, videos, and audio as cohesive interwoven elements that enrich the story, adding aggregated value when working together. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence is reshaping content creation in myriad ways. AI now assists journalists with story idea generation, interview preparation, transcription, translation, and even writing. In practical terms, this is another revolution that reshapes the writing process itself. Soon, many routine stories across news departments — world and national briefs, business earnings reports, sports summaries — will be AI-generated. This evolution frees human writers to focus on what truly sets their work apart: authentic, personal voice and distinctive style. As a result, journalists will increasingly employ an “I was there” approach, embedding unique perspectives and insights into their work — their signature, or what I call the scent of the writer. This infusion of AI-driven content will make the distinct voice of the human writer more essential than ever. As AI-generated content becomes ubiquitous, the qualities that define human writing — authenticity, emotional depth, and creative intuition — will become even more critical, ensuring that a writer’s presence is felt throughout a narrative. As journalists adapt to these dual revolutions, they’ll find themselves conceptualizing content with a mobile-first perspective — crafting stories to flow seamlessly from small to large platforms. The human byline will also gain significance, with writers making their mark from the very first paragraph. This shift may even lead to a resurgence of first-person narratives as journalists strive to connect with readers more intimately. Ultimately, these revolutions — mobile-first and AI — will redefine journalism at its core, empowering journalists to craft stories that are both technologically advanced and unmistakably human. Journalists will find themselves amid two revolutions that directly affect the craft of journalism. Mario García  is CEO of García Media. "

  "prediction": "Readers who have been tuning out and disengaging from the news will begin turning back to trusted online sources once the new year gets rolling, but not in the numbers that we saw during the pandemic. It might take a while to emerge from what some are calling their “cocooning,” and it won’t be enough for journalists to blare the latest twists and turns at the Capitol and sit back and wait for another so-called Trump bump. The key for those outside of New York and Washington will be to intensify their focus on local, on problem-solving, and on bringing understanding to complex issues in chaotic times. News organizations that emphasize quality over quantity will stand apart from the aggregators and wire-heavy sites that lack a connection and relevancy in people’s lives. Success and sustainability are tied more closely to reader loyalty than to viral hot takes and page views. Yes, print will continue to decline, and public radio will face its own ongoing challenges as hybrid work and the popularity of SiriusXM, Spotify, and other streaming services mean fewer people catch up on the news as they drive to and from the office. It’s not all bad, however. Contraction will be accompanied by more collaboration across platforms. We’re launching just such an effort here in Colorado in 2025 that expands statehouse coverage through the Colorado Capitol News Alliance, an initiative that involves public radio KUNC, Colorado Public Radio, Rocky Mountain PBS, and The Colorado Sun. Financed by a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the alliance will support the hiring of additional resources to cover the Colorado State Capitol and state government entities, with partners collaborating on news reporting, editorial planning, and digital distribution along with a weekly podcast. Here at the Sun, we are exploring other collaborations and new ways to reach readers across our state. It’s a far cry from the zero-sum days of cutthroat competition, and it gives me hope about the good work we will do together in the year ahead.

  "summary": "“This isn’t just about technology. It’s about recommitting to our mission of serving the public good.”",
  "prediction": "The rapid pace of technological change, volatile ad revenues, intense digital competition, and the ever-shifting preferences of audiences make maintaining a sustainable business model daunting. For public media, these challenges are compounded by a fragmented market and political pressures. Yet public media remains an indispensable community asset. Years ago, I rappelled down a 400-foot building and hung a banner for a cause I deeply believed in. That story gets laughs over drinks, but it underscores an early lesson: Purpose matters. Purpose is what drives public media today as we navigate a critical inflection point. Last year, I  raised the alarm : Public radio must embrace digital audio, particularly podcasting. Podcasts are no longer niche. They are a core part of the media landscape, offering perspective, storytelling, and information to millions. The roots of podcasting run deep in public radio, built on decades of meaningful discussion, investigative journalism, and creative storytelling. Many of podcasting’s most celebrated producers honed their craft in public radio.  Does this mean our work is done, that we should concede the race? Not so fast. I experienced firsthand the fractured media ecosystem on election night — opinions scattered across networks, projections hidden behind paywalls, and limited access to trustworthy, independent coverage. In contrast, public media stands apart. No other system in the world matches the accessibility, independence, and sheer reach of the U.S. public media network. It is a beacon of trust and an essential public service. The  principles  of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 still resonate today. They call for programming that takes creative risks and serves unserved and underserved audiences. They encourage freedom, imagination, and initiative at both local and national levels. These tenets guide our work and push us to evolve. Our industry faces extraordinary challenges. Commercial pressures threaten our independence and digital giants dominate the landscape. But public media is uniquely positioned to adapt. By championing podcasting alongside traditional outlets, we can expand our reach and strengthen our relevance. This isn’t just about technology. It’s about recommitting to our mission of serving the public good. In 2025, podcasting’s roots in public radio will have an opportunity to grow even deeper. But this requires more than innovation; it demands investment. Investment in technological evolution and digital infrastructure, yes, but also investment in each other—our people, our creativity, and our shared mission. Public media’s future depends on embracing transformation while staying true to the ideals that have defined us for nearly 60 years. Together, we can ensure that public media remains a vital force, offering trusted content to everyone, everywhere. Kerri Hoffman  is CEO of  PRX . "

  "prediction": "In the year ahead, editors, stretched thin by the demands of daily news and shrinking staff, will adopt new approaches and technology to ease work burdens and unleash reporters to tackle stories with greater depth and engagement. In the past year, I’ve enjoyed conversations with dozens of Evergreen State leaders seeking to host one of 16 local news fellows hired for the program I manage for Washington State University’s Edward R. Murrow  College of Communication . Many of these smaller newsrooms are so stretched that they don’t have time to learn and leverage  Gather strategies ,  LION sustainability support ,  Microsoft’s newsroom AI efforts , or to pursue desperately needed money (whether from local philanthropists or  Press Forward ) or coaching (from the Local Media Association’s  Lab for Journalism Funding , for instance). Directing news workers is an issue, too. I’ve noticed organizations (many among next month’s Washington census and ecosystem  report to be posted here ) still try to produce at a volume that was barely possible when staffs were 20% to 50% larger and when audiences are most focused on cell phones, not the morning paper or evening newscast. From my observations of Washington newsrooms, smaller shops don’t have the time to stop current practices to learn how to instruct ChatGPT to “summarize this press release to 100 words and produce a six to 10-word headline.” Or to explore, much less implement, the Trusting News “ trust kits ” on transparency or listening techniques.  Or to move away from inverted pyramids or 30-second “on the scene” standups that can be both time-intensive and ineffectual. The news sector must jettison many traditional practices and adapt/adopt creative approaches to entice  news consumers  and  news avoiders  to want to stay informed. To do so effectively, this year more news leaders, especially in smaller organizations, will: The first step might be contrary to mission: sharpen the story budget, produce less news (all too often dismissed at a glance) and pursue approaches that personalize thorny local issues and strengthen the connective tissue of a community, regardless of political leanings. 2025 will be a year of implementing against-norms tactics to nurture greater understanding of issues impactful to all strata in American society. Our industry’s paramount responsibility is to distribute compelling content that is creative, effective and consumed and that rings true to them. That’ll require revising approaches to help citizens recognize, then trust, the Fourth Estate’s role in preserving a democracy.

  "summary": "“Today’s media faces a paradox: Professionals want constant updates and insights but suffer from overwhelming information streams.”",
  "prediction": "In the coming year, B2B digital media will evolve from traditional content publishing to holistic “solution hubs” that prioritize actionable intelligence and deep interactivity over static content. This shift will see B2B media transform into platforms that connect, educate, and empower professionals with immediate, custom-fit insights where the value lies in utility versus volume. Here are some of the ways that transformation will play out: We’ll see a move away from drowning users in information to curated, on-demand knowledge.  Today’s media faces a paradox: Professionals want constant updates and insights but suffer from overwhelming information streams. AI-powered tools will be key, enabling media brands to deliver precisely curated insights, designed around the user’s unique role, industry challenges, and learning preferences. This shift will transform passive readers into active participants, accessing resources that feel like personal intelligence briefings tailored to their immediate needs. Publishers will develop interactive, experiential learning at scale.  In a B2B context, learning needs to be both immersive and directly applicable. I’m not sure we’ll see this widely in 2025, but I’d bet we’ll see B2B media increasingly integrate experiential learning formats, from AR/VR experiences to gamified simulations that mimic real-world decision-making. Imagine an HR media company offering an interactive simulation where people leaders can test employee engagement strategies in a virtual workplace environment or a tech publication allowing IT leaders to “test drive” cybersecurity strategies in a virtual environment. There is a need for new revenue models focused on direct value creation.  I don’t know that I have a prediction here, but am intrigued by ideas I’ve read for hybrid subscription models that link specific outcomes to revenue. Instead of solely offering annual subscriptions in this model, publishers would provide a “pay-per-solution” approach, where subscribers can pay for immediate access to consulting, proprietary research, or exclusive tools when they need it most. This approach helps move subscriptions from discretionary to necessary — to me the most important component of any media brand’s long-term success. In a sea of AI content, ethics and trust will be differentiators.  I’m sure this will get a lot of eyes rolling, but as AI-generated content becomes ubiquitous and in a world where mainstream media really struggles with trust, B2B brands that adhere to and invest in transparency, verification, and ethical reporting will stand out. In 2025, B2B media could highlight “human verification” as a premium feature, with editors, industry experts, or subject-matter specialists validating content accuracy and relevance. Trust may accelerate for B2B media (really all media) in an era that combines presidential assaults with AI confusion to frustrate consumers. B2B consumers likely lead the way in the  need  for credible information. So in 2025, I think we’ll see the B2B media landscape start to become a blend of content and actionable solutions, experimenting with interactive, highly relevant tools and experiences that empower professionals in tangible ways. This shift will eventually set a new standard in B2B media in an era focused on personal relevance and measurable impact. Jay Lauf  is co-founder and chief commercial officer of  Charter . "

  "summary": "“But most governance — even extreme governance — is banal. If Project 2025 is anything to go by, journalists need to focus more on the boring minutiae of policymaking and not on the sensationalism of politics.”",
  "prediction": "When Fox News pushed back on the lies that the U.S. presidential election in 2020 was “stolen,” viewers flocked to far-right outlets like OAN and Newsmax. As the  Dominion Voting System’s lawsuit against Fox News showed , people inside Fox News were so nervous about losing parts of their audience that they caved and gave the audience what they wanted: more lies. The more a media outlet caters to its audience, the more it becomes  dependent  on its audience. This is especially true in a hypercompetitive media market in which the audience’s attention is a scarce resource. And the impact of audiences — often measured through data analytics such as clicks, shares, and likes — can impact the story’s position on the website and whether to produce similar stories. These analytics affect a media outlet’s agenda and can make or break careers. This  dependence  on audiences is one risk of newsrooms’ reliance on audiences to finance their business models. Newsrooms cater to what audiences  want  more than what they  need . The other risk of this audience-driven business model,  facticity , stems from news value research which, in short, concerns the factors that make an event newsworthy or not. Facticity is the idea that some events are more newsworthy than others simply because of what they  are . An earthquake, for example, has a high facticity rating because it is immediate, it is drastic, and we can easily understand it. Climate change, on the other hand, has a low facticity rating because it is complex, slowly developing (climate, after all, is the average weather over 30 years), and hard to pinpoint. And while extreme weather events “help” climate change coverage because of their facticity, most stories surrounding climate change are abstract and complex and hard to pitch. Indeed, this is an issue that climate change journalists have been struggling with since the 1980s: How can we report on a topic that affects everyone but has a terrible news value? My former professor once remarked that the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung didn’t care about its audience — but this wasn’t meant as a bad thing. This was not to say that they did not appreciate their audience, but rather that the publication wrote stories that they thought needed to be told and not the stories that their audience wanted to read. That was in the late 2000s, at the early stages of analytics-informed journalism. Journalists today should adopt this approach to their audiences. In 2025, news organizations will hear the audience’s siren song louder and clearer than ever before. Journalists will wrestle with abandoning Twitter/X — and the audiences they built there — for Bluesky. They will worry about the drop in engagement for their stories as the algorithms for platforms like  Twitter/X  and  Threads  do not reward linking to outside sources. And they will hear the audience’s siren call when they look at the analytics of their latest stories. But if the audience’s attention affects editorial decision-making, then we need to come to terms with the fact that the audience does not necessarily know what’s good for it. Instead, journalists need to consider what their audiences  need . The far-right administration that will take over the U.S. will undoubtedly produce scandal after scandal. If the first four years of the Trump presidency were not evidence enough, just look to the last few weeks after the 2024 election, whether it was nominating Matt Gaetz for attorney general or apparently jokingly offering to annex Canada as the 51st state. The next four years will be full of stories that are full of facticity and that audiences will consume — a boon for journalists’ analytics. But most governance — even extreme governance — is banal. If Project 2025 is anything to go by, journalists need to focus more on the boring minutiae of policymaking and not on the sensationalism of politics. For that, journalists need to borrow from climate journalists to learn how to cover an extremely important event that most people don’t care about. They need to cover their ears to the audience’s siren song and publish what the audience needs to know — even if readers aren’t interested.

  "prediction": "This past year, higher education has weathered significant shifts and/or turmoil in leadership; inclusion, diversity and equity practices, and student enrollment, all influenced by economic challenges, demographic changes and political headwinds. College athletics, too, have new policies around name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights, moving toward professionalism and giving athletes greater control over their personal brands and financial opportunities. In this evolving landscape, journalism educators continue to prepare their students for technological advancements and shifting consumer behaviors driving the industry. In 2025, college journalism programs will push forward and adapt to meet workforce demands, student expectations and community needs. Keep an eye on developments in these key areas: Ethics and misinformation : Journalism programs will double down on ethics and critical thinking as misinformation spreads. Discerning between “fake news” and truth will be trickier than ever. As noted by the  Reuters Institute , the lines between types of content — like political propaganda, satire, advertisement, and, yes, poor journalism — are increasingly blurred. Student journalists who master verification tools for sources, identities, locations and images will not only strengthen their reporting capacities but also stand out in the competitive marketplace for internships and jobs. Global perspectives : Training the next generation of journalists means preparing them to be global citizens.  Recent reports  show that doing so can significantly boost students’ professional and personal growth. Journalism schools will broaden global experiences to enhance intercultural communication skills and cultural awareness. From study abroad programs to international collaborations, these initiatives will help students better address universal issues with well-rounded perspectives. Artificial intelligence : Expect AI instruction to become more prevalent as professors demonstrate its relevance in research, data analysis, content creation and dissemination. Understanding AI will help students position themselves in  media organizations eager to leverage the technology . Additionally, educators will engage students to a greater extent in discussions about the ethical implications of AI, including privacy, bias, fairness, transparency and accountability. Local news and community engagement : With the  accelerated loss of local newspapers , many more communities will become news deserts, leading to decreased civic and political engagement. Journalism programs and independent student media will continue to fill these information gaps. More funding for projects and initiatives that support student journalists and local news ecosystems will come forward. Diversity and belonging : Despite the dismantling of diversity programs and positions at many higher ed institutions, journalism schools will be at the forefront of fostering inclusive learning environments. These academic programs will partner with each other and nonprofit organizations to create courses and projects that reflect diverse lived experiences. These collaborations will support the needs and interests of students, faculty, staff and community stakeholders, cultivating welcoming environments and respectful conversations in which everyone feels valued and included. By reinforcing ethics and combating misinformation, fostering global perspectives, integrating AI, saving local news and ensuring diversity and belonging, journalism education in 2025 will prepare well-rounded, ethically minded and global students to meet the challenges of a transformative era.

  "prediction": "I’m thrilled to see so many news organizations — in some cases with the help of key funding partners — investing in a concerted exploration of generative AI and what it means for the mission and business of journalism. Our industry has an unfortunate history of having disruptive emerging technologies inflicted upon it, putting us on the defensive and forcing us to begrudgingly adapt. But this time around, it feels like we’re taking some welcome initiative. Fantastic. From  The New York Times  and  The Washington Post  to  nonprofit news  to chains like  Hearst  and  McClatchy  to  independent regional outfits  like ours, it seems every news organization with the means to do so is launching small teams to experiment with these technologies. Good on all of us. I can’t wait to see what comes of it. My prediction for 2025 is that many of these teams will be focused on immediate, real-world problems and quick wins. Between the demands of grant funding and the speculative nature of these investments by media companies, there will naturally be some pressure to show visible successes quickly. And that’s great! There’s plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s a great place to get started. That said, my hope is that we don’t stop there. The world of “AI” is vast and includes much more than the generative models that have captured the public imagination. We can do more than build wrappers around tools like ChatGPT, valuable as they might be. We should also find the time and energy to invest in working from first principles and trying to break some new ground. In that spirit, I thought I’d highlight a few areas of research and development that, at least to me, seem worthy of our industry’s attention. Perhaps they would make good areas for collaboration, either among ourselves or with academic and industry partners. But at the very least I offer them as food for thought as we begin to explore this space in earnest heading into 2025: Our team is eager to collaborate on these areas and others.

Emerging media has always had a sizable role in election outcomes, from the  “TV election”  of 1960 to the  “Twitter election”  in 2012. And although  podcasts have been around for 20 years , the 2024 race decidedly became the first  “podcast election.”  Which makes sense given the upward trajectory for listenership: According to Edison Research’s  Infinite Dial 2024  report, 100 million Americans listen to at least one podcast every week, and a recent  IAB report  shows that Gen Z and millennials spend the majority of their time consuming audio content. It’s easy to see why the best way to reach key voters this election cycle was through podcasts: All it took was one strategically placed interview on a massive podcast to hit millions of young and engaged and persuadable listeners. (As opposed to a few hour-long cable broadcast interviews on legacy media networks, whose set-in-their-ways audiences combined would still  only account for a fraction  of the high-target reach a single podcast interview could provide.) And in the final days on the campaign trail, that’s exactly why the candidates dropped by some of the biggest podcasts in the world to get out the vote, with Kamala Harris appearing on  eight shows,  including Call Her Daddy and The Breakfast Club, and Donald Trump sitting down for  20 podcast conversations  with hosts like Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman. Based on the  average reach of each show , Trump’s podcast appearances reached approximately 23.5 million Americans as compared to Harris’ 6.4 million. If we learned anything in the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election, it’s that podcasting has evolved from a supplementary media channel into a primary battleground for political discourse and voter engagement. And in 2025, this transformation will continue to accelerate, reshaping how notable figures and organizations promote their ideas, how media outlets approach coverage, and how audiences consume information. Here’s how: The “podcast election” may be over, but the real podcast work — to make real, meaningful, and engaging change — is just beginning.

  "prediction": "Will 2025 be the year that users embrace generative AI-enabled news? There’s no shortage of players betting that it’s coming.  Ask  Perplexity  about some current event, and it’ll helpfully summarize the information from a half-dozen news sites, including links so you can check its accuracy for yourself.  MIcrosoft’s  Bing  and Google’s  Gemini  — and others — will do much the same thing. And The Washington Post recently launched  Ask the Post AI , a chatbot that answers questions based on the Post’s reporting and archives. Whether readers cotton on to this way of getting news remains to be seen. But if and when they switch from reading news to having stories created for them by AI on the fly, it’ll herald a seismic change in the news industry — upending how we work, what we create, and how we make money. We’d be smart to get ahead of it. To be sure, there are many hurdles to overcome before a world of GenAI-created news becomes commonplace, not least questions about how accurate such systems are. But it’s also not hard to see the attractions — for users, at least — of such a world: A world, at least in theory, where you don’t have to hunt through multiple stories and sources to get a range of perspectives, including from foreign language-publications; where  context you already know  doesn’t clog up copy and background you’ve forgotten is just a query away.  A world where systems know what you’re interested in and how much time you have to read. The technology to create much of this world is already largely here; but is this something we should welcome? It’s possible many more people are much better informed in a world where AI agents scour the web and find and summarize information that matters to them, giving them access to far more news than they can currently access; it’s equally possible we’re all sucked deeper and deeper into information silos as we read only what is created for us. The only thing that’s certain is that the world of journalism, and the work of journalists, will change profoundly.  Sure, there will always be a place for deep investigative work, sparkling writing, and carefully crafted, insightful narratives.  But that’s not what most journalism is; we’re largely in the much more mundane business of informing readers about that day’s events. And that’s the work that AI systems will disrupt first. What’s the value of a narrative story if it isn’t widely read; if, instead, its facts, insights and analysis are extracted and reworded by an AI system?  Is there any point to being the third news organization to confirm some piece of information? Will news brands blur into each other in AI-summarized stories, even if prominent credit (and links) are given to each organization?  How can advertising- and traffic-based business models survive if there’s less and less need to visit news sites? Will readers be happy to stay in siloed subscription gardens if they can get multiple views and perspectives from AI systems? How should journalists and news organizations adapt to this world?  Some things come to mind. True exclusive information — scoops — will be critical.  Smart, unique insights will be hard to replicate.  Voice and personality can attract and retain readers. It might not hurt to rethink what a “ story ” really is. In-person events — “Live Journalism,” as we call it at Semafor — can’t, at least for the moment, be carried out by chatbots. And deep engagement with, and knowledge of, the community you serve is one way to keep them loyal. (Luckily, all things Semafor is leaning into.) But I’d be lying if I said I knew what will work in a brave new world of AI news. I only know that we should be actively preparing for it. Gina Chua  is executive editor of Semafor. "

  "headline": "Antitrust and AI news converge and get local",
  "summary": "“While compensation deals between AI companies and news publishers may sound good, who gives what and under what conditions depends on bargaining power.”",
  "prediction": "In my  Nieman Lab prediction for 2023 , I expected to see a rise in antitrust news. It has indeed been a packed two years for reporters in this beat, often involving market regulation and consumer protection stories. Google faced  three monopoly trials , with  one of them  poised to  reshape ad revenues  for news publishers. Similarly, Grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons — who are attempting to merge — faced off the Federal Trade Commission, and the states of Washington and Colorado, in  three separate trials  this year. AI has also entered into the equation in a massive way. News first introduced us to AI tools as a shiny, new way of producing and using synthetic content. Shorty after, we learned the risks of this AI rollout to workers, especially in  journalism  and the  creative industries , as well as  for climate change  and  people’s safety . The reporting on real impacts of large-scale AI in society helped us pull away from distracting narratives of  AI-driven dystopian and utopian worlds . Although it may not be immediately clear, all these issues are pertinent to competition and antitrust. In the year ahead, as more journalists delve into AI risks and harms, I expect to see these issues converge under an antitrust lens. Since the Trump administration is likely to roll back executive orders on competition and AI regulation, my hope is that more journalists pivot their attention to state and local coverage of these issues. There are already some clear examples of this convergence of AI and antitrust. In the litigation of  Google’s search monopoly  in D.C., the judge overseeing the case just decided that  assessing the impact of AI in search  will be part of the remedies trial next April. For journalists, this involves developing a deeper understanding of how foundation models are built, and how technology companies operating multiple lines of business can leverage existing  data advantages  to entrench their power  in nascent markets . Other angles are hidden gems. About media: while compensation deals between AI companies and news publishers may sound good, who gives what and under what conditions depends on bargaining power. Are such deals going to restrict journalists’ ability to use other AI companies’ tools, or maybe the type of reporting they do on the AI companies the publishers have deals with? It’s no surprise that newer companies such as OpenAI (backed by Microsoft) and Perplexity AI — facing copyright litigation — are seeking these deals with publishers. In contrast, it’s almost impossible to negotiate with older and larger companies such as Google, Meta, or Amazon about the use of news content in their AI models. A bigger question for local journalism arises too. The more updated and unique information is, the  more value it has for an AI model . So, how are local outlets going to capitalize on that opportunity? Can they do so without sacrificing editorial independence? On workers: going back to the example in media, how is the revenue from the AI deals going to be invested in journalists? Independent creators using social media or e-learning platforms for a living, will they control how  their work is used  by those companies’ AI models? How much further will labor protections be eroded by the  poor pay and surveillance of workers  behind data labeling for AI training? (This is not, by the way, a problem exclusive to developing countries). On climate change: the impact of embedding AI in everything we do cannot be measured without scrutinizing how data centers work —  the power and water resources needed  — and what states sacrifice in order to host data centers (hint: tax breaks). Even more urgent is reporting on how intrinsically at odds is building an environmentally resilient future with Big Tech rushing to profit from AI (especially as this sector pushes  to revive nuclear power ). The list goes on. Attorneys general across the country are likely to continue leading the charge in antitrust enforcement. We will likely see more state action in the proposed Kroger-Albertsons merge. In Texas, Google will face a new trial for monopolizing digital advertising next April, distinct from the federal case. Lawsuits against Amazon’s alleged monopolization of online retail are also steadily  moving forward in Washington, D.C., and California . The antitrust beat and its intersections with various sectors that affect people’s lives and small businesses is far from over. Perhaps, a push for this type of reporting is what’s missing to  rebuild trust  in journalism. Karina Montoya  is a senior reporter and policy analyst at the  Open Markets Institute . "

  "summary": "“This coming year will see major growth in online progressive media. What’s harder to predict is which communities will see themselves represented in this media. Which communities will hear this media speaking to their experiences and frustrations?”",
  "prediction": "For  many   commentators , the 2024 election drove home the power of the ever-evolving right-wing media ecosystem. There seems to be something about the parasocial bonds that people build with media personalities who they spend a lot of time with, and who offer stories to make sense of day-to-day public life, that goes deeper than celebrity endorsements, door knocks, or impact-tested ads. So in 2025, the push to start building a competing media sphere is on the mind of many left/progressive/center-left activists, entrepreneurs, and donors. What will these efforts look like? There have been online left-leaning media spheres in the recent past, both real and imagined. In the mid-2010s, BuzzFeed News, Vice Media, and Vox Media were seen as beacons pointing toward the  future of online news . They were celebrated as innovative and savvily attuned to internet culture. And they arguably shared a (moderately) progressive outlook. Today, BuzzFeed News  has shut down . Vice Media  went bankrupt . And Vox Media has gone through  rounds of layoffs . The initial rise of such sites offered hope that the digital news boom would bode well for progressive voices. Today, the dream that the invisible hand of the commercial internet will deliver a popular and thriving progressive media sphere sits in an ashy dustbin. Next to it lies an earlier fantasy of  techno-leftists  and horizontalism enthusiasts who saw  Indymedia and radical citizen journalists  coming to power once the internet toppled media gatekeepers. If a truly influential left media sphere is to grow from these ashes, it’s going to entail plenty of varied experiments — but also an against-the-headwinds commitment to building media that appeals to those beyond the ranks of college-educated, highly engaged groups already invested in progressive politics. This won’t happen spontaneously. It’s going to take coordinated efforts. Media ventures that depend on money from loyal subscribers — or those that need to please donors by showing quick results in attracting engagement — will be pulled toward catering to the niche already cultivated by progressives. Perhaps they’ll grow at impressive speeds, but they’ll find themselves preaching to the choir. Media scholar Reece Peck put it well when he told me he worries the danger for progressive media activists is “fetishizing the medium.” They may set their sights only on establishing progressive brands on online video and podcasting platforms, but continue to speak only to the kind of audiences that already share their tastes and socio-economic backgrounds. Moving more content onto these formats alone won’t be enough to compete with the right-wing media sphere. While some components of the right-wing media sphere have always been calibrated only to serve fellow ideologues, others have positioned themselves as entryways into conservatism. They have done this by appealing to popular tastes and speaking to social groups not otherwise courted by either mainstream media or progressive outreach. This coming year will see major growth in online progressive media. What’s harder to predict is which communities will see themselves represented in this media. Which communities will hear this media speaking to their experiences and frustrations? Which communities will see this media speaking to their tastes and longings to make stories of political life captivating and maybe even re-enchanting?

  "summary": "“Preserving public broadcasting in its current form is not an option. So let’s hold hands together and leap.”",
  "prediction": "When public media makes the news these days, it’s usually in the form of a negative headline. Accusations of liberal bias have made organizations like PBS and NPR the target of right-wing efforts to defund the entire system. And reports of audience and revenue decline have left newsroom leaders “fried and frozen,” a phrase coined by Colorado News Collaborative executive director Laura Frank. But it wasn’t always so. In the sixties, as the country experienced a divisive series of cascading political and social crises (sound familiar?), a  group of luminaries , like novelist Ralph Ellison, teamed with scientists, academic leaders, and others to consider how a changing media landscape — driven by the arrival of television —  could  “deepen a sense of community in local life” and “help us look at our achievements and difficulties, at our conflicts and agreements.” The Carnegie Commission, the formal name given to this team of information architects, was full of big thinkers. Together, they envisioned a vast network of local television stations that would lean into their viewers’ educational and civic needs, entertaining them along the way. Politicians rallied to their cause and passed the Public Broadcasting Act, which led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and, later, NPR. The infrastructure they designed gave us Mr. Rogers, Sesame Street, Nova, and Fresh Air with Terry Gross, among many others. Millions of Americans were enriched by programming that dropped them into creative worlds, connecting them to new ideas. You know what happened next. Cable TV. Then streaming. YouTube. Mix in the social media platforms and instead of peeking into new worlds, we’re fortifying the walls of our own. Hidden algorithms tailor our experiences to reinforce beliefs and biases. All this while public media’s audiences are aging and public norms erode. The Carnegie Commission didn’t see it coming. How could they? They still had to get up off the couch to change the channel. But here we are. And something has to give. Because while public broadcasting’s means of production and delivery have changed, the ideals still hold. There has never been a more urgent time in our history to connect us back to our communities and open ourselves to fresh perspectives. I know it’s easier said than done. Reading  the Carnegie Commission’s 1967 report  is like being airdropped onto the set of “The West Wing” — an idealized version of public discourse. It’s hard to imagine that people with diverse backgrounds could come together to conjure a new public good. But there are modern examples. Take the Highline in New York City. A rusty and abandoned railway was transformed by residents into a dynamic public space serving modern community needs. It connects different neighborhoods, attracts tourists, and honors the city’s past, while forging a new future. My  prediction  prescription for 2025 is that civic leaders, educators, artists, and scientists of all political stripes can convene the modern-day equivalent of the Carnegie Commission to reimagine and redesign a new, networked media space, accessible to all, to serve the informational and educational needs of both individuals and communities. Preserving public broadcasting in its current form is not an option. So let’s hold hands together and leap. Kristen Muller  is the former chief content officer at  LAist . "

  "summary": "“Journalists are already content creators and even ‘influencers.’ They’re simply asking to get paid for it.”",
  "prediction": "Have you been on social media lately? Most Americans spend a great deal of time there, and journalists are no different. Since social media became mainstream, and likely even before that, journalists have spent time on multiple platforms disseminating news and finding sources. But the line between journalist-with-a-capital-J and content creator is starting to blur. Journalists and those who study them have coined terms such as reciprocal journalism, social media branding, aspirational labor, and more to identify what journalists do online and the content they create beyond just disseminating news. But what we’re starting to see increasingly is journalists putting themselves out there as public figures. They make themselves available to the public to see who they are as people and not just the stories they tell as journalists. This includes behind the scenes looks into their personal lives as they get ready for work or take their dog for a walk. And while some journalists do this simply for the fun of it, many do it at the behest of management who sees value in having a public drawn to journalists as people. Some say it can help build trust, while others say it helps increase views, clicks, or subscriptions. But much of this labor goes unpaid. Some journalists do it with the aspirational hope to monetize someday; others do it to perhaps increase followership and thusly make themselves more marketable when looking for jobs and negotiating salaries. While journalism ethics have long said journalists must remain neutral, third-party observers who avoid conflicts of interest, others have begun to question whether the unpaid nature of this social media content creation is exploitation. And journalists are beginning to question whether it truly is unethical for them to accept brand deals for sponsored content on their social media accounts. Just last month while on Facebook, I was on a private page for broadcast journalists (which I will keep unnamed for privacy) and one journalist posed the question, “Has anyone been able to negotiate the right to earn commissions on their own social media into their contract?” Ironically, days later, another group member posted, “Any recommendations for seasonal jobs that work well with a nightside shift? I’m in desperate need for a little extra holiday cash (and rent money).” It is no secret that journalism doesn’t pay well and as journalists spend copious time on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and the like, they are looking to make that often unpaid labor, well, paid. And herein lies my prediction: Journalism will shift what it considers to be “conflicts of interest” so that news organizations will allow their journalists to make money off their social media content if they wish. Put simply, journalistic norms and contracts that dictate journalists can’t — or shouldn’t — accept sponsored content opportunities on their social media accounts will shift. We’ll see more journalists requesting that their organizations allow such opportunities, and we’ll begin to see a shift in norms that suggest to accept such brand deals would be unethical. The idea being, if news organizations are going to push journalists more and more to put themselves out there on social media — including their personal lives in the content they create — they will need to reconsider what they see as a “gift” versus clear compensation for the labor of social media content creation. It’s outside the scope of this prediction for me to expound much more. However, what I will say is that journalists are already content creators and even “influencers.” They’re simply asking to get paid for it. Organizations will need to acquiesce or see even more young and talented journalists leave for careers that are open to paying them for their labor. Kaitlin C.

  "prediction": "In 2019, Wendy Dean, Simon Talbot, and Austin Dean wrote in  the journal Federal Practitioner  about an increase in clinicians leaving medicine due to “burnout.” The reality, they argued, was something different — the reason for so many resignations was the gap between their moral values of putting patient care first, and the inhumane reality of the American healthcare system. They defined this gap as “moral injury.” In 2025, I believe that we’ll see this happen in journalism on an unprecedented scale. The only way to avoid it is to close the gap between our stated values and the common behaviors of our profession. The values of journalism are clear: to provide an essential, reliable service that is trusted and beneficial to people’s lives, especially for those who need us most. Our behavior, however, has often strayed from this goal. Much of our output is on media that is hard to access (newspapers, paywalls, using language and formats that are hard to understand without a college degree), writing stories solely for  SEO  and revenue generation, choosing narratives that don’t  center those most impacted by a story , often legitimizing harm through  a bias towards power , while presenting  existing systemic problems  as unsolvable. In too many places, we’ve limited our ambition and outreach, focusing dwindling resources on doing less for fewer people. Working conditions for most journalists are hard enough; in the coming political climate, the moral injury that these choices inflict will be too much for many to bear in 2025. Unless. We need to change our actions to be closer to our values. This means taking a hard look at how we report, the tools we build, how we make our work accessible (and for whom), how we listen to and engage with communities, how we publish for and convene our audiences…and being prepared to make changes, always with the goal of being an essential, relevant, trusted resource that  actively improves people’s lives . This is how we bring audiences back, and how we keep our colleagues from quitting in exhaustion and despair. For many organizations, what I’m describing requires  culture change . The “good” news is that things are now desperate enough for most that change is the only choice. And we don’t have to be pioneers in any of this. There are many community organizations that media companies can partner with and learn from, groups who are already trusted, relevant, and essential to different communities. That is, as long as you can persuade them to trust you. There are many local news organizations already doing this work. Epicenter  partners with local artists  to raise awareness of issues among communities.  Conecta Arizona  uses WhatsApp, collaborating with local content creators to share essential information. Jersey Bee  provides SMS updates  highlighting free food distribution in the area.  Charlottesville Tomorrow  provides Take Action boxes on their stories, directing readers to make an impact on what matters most to them. The Kansas City Defender hosted  a clothing drive . City Bureau pays local residents across the country to  document  public meetings.  Documented  (for whom I’m an advisor) publishes essential, multilingual information for immigrants in New York on WeChat, WhatsApp, and Nextdoor. Each of these organizations is able to leverage the trust they’ve built to report community stories that larger, traditional newsrooms miss. They show up for their communities, and their communities show up for them. But these are among the few exceptions. The majority of our industry remains at odds with its high-minded purpose, cursed by the norms that its legacies seem to demand. I’ve talked to several journalists who believe that their work is at best neutral, and sometimes actively perpetuating harm among communities where they should be seeking common cause. No wonder that journalists are less trusted than ever. It’s not too late. We still have so many talented, thoughtful people who want to do great journalism that improves lives. But 2025 is going to be a tough year, for so many reasons. In order to better support our communities, to prove why journalism can be essential, and to keep ourselves and our colleagues from burnout and moral injury, we must close the gap between our values and our actions.

  "summary": "“With so many competing startups vying to serve this emerging market, there will be lots of opportunities for publishers — and in some cases journalists who have their own newsletters or websites — to experiment.”",
  "prediction": "Journalism faces unprecedented challenges in 2025 as the intersection of artificial intelligence, content creation, and business models reaches a critical juncture. As Google and Meta continue to pivot away from news while introducing new generative AI search and chatbots, the limited revenue and access to audiences that publishers were able to obtain from referral traffic is set to decline further, meaning that adaptation is not optional — it’s existential. The  valuation  and protection of journalistic content in an era of aggressive AI-driven content extraction is taking place against a backdrop of increasing integration of AI in the newsroom and operations. After a flurry of  partnerships and licensing deals  with the most prestigious and content-rich news brands over the past year, Big Tech firms Google, Meta, Microsoft, and (Microsoft-backed OpenAI) are unlikely to pursue as many in the year to come as they  continue to claim fair use  for text and data-mining amid a  slew of lawsuits  that will take years to resolve. This strategic co-optation of publishers with the biggest and highest quality portfolios — which also happen to be those with the resources to sue — will create a stark divide in the media ecosystem, where only the largest publishers with guaranteed content pipelines will secure AI partnerships with the Big Tech firms and AI unicorns. This will leave the long-tail of smaller, regional, local, ethnic, investigative, and specialized outlets struggling to adapt to an environment in which referral traffic from search and social media continues its precipitous decline amid increasing competition from AI-generated content farms and AI-curated news apps. However, there is also an opportunity for those newsrooms left out of deals — the “long tail” of journalism. AI companies will need to solve  the problem of declining access to quality data  — a trend that is likely to become more acute as publishers restrict the unfettered crawling of their websites by AI bots and experiment with new ways to license and monetize their archival and real-time content. There is also a growing array of AI startups that are consumer-facing or aim to provide business-oriented services that rely on access to relevant, timely, and reliable content and can’t afford to flout copyright or offer indemnity to their customers, like the Big Tech firms do. Publishers are entering this complex new terrain of content valuation with limited information on  how to establish the value of their journalism  in this new AI-driven ecosystem. This means that 2025 will be the year of learning and experimentation. Publishers will figure out how to distinguish between training and inference data, and why retrieval augmentation generation (RAG), a process that retrieves relevant information from external sources to supplement large language models, could offer more diverse and lucrative revenue streams than selling off their archives to train large language models. They will need to experiment with a range of licensing solutions that aim to connect content industries with AI models. The news industry will be forced to develop nuanced pricing models for different content use cases, with particular attention to archival content, original journalism, and local reporting. This represents a crucial pivot from previous passive approaches to content licensing, making it imperative to learn from other industries like music, which has a more nuanced and dynamic approach to licensing that includes rights and compensation for musicians and composers, not just corporate content owners. 2025 will see significant experimentation between publishers and AI companies, from those run by former Big Tech news execs like  Tollbit  and  HumanNative  to others like  ProRata ,  Sphere , and  Emergent Methods  that have fewer ties to the platforms that eviscerated the business models of digital journalism. This competitive innovation landscape creates unique opportunities for publishers and independent journalists to explore diverse AI licensing models and see what works for them. With so many competing startups vying to serve this emerging market, there will be lots of opportunities for publishers — and in some cases journalists who have their own newsletters or websites — to experiment and try out the different services. Which means that investing in technical expertise, forming collaboratives to learn and perhaps even share technical resources, and collective approaches will become increasingly important. 2025 will be defined by journalism’s strategic recalibration in response to AI’s disruptive potential. Success will depend on publishers’ ability to understand their content’s value, develop technical sophistication, and navigate a complex, rapidly evolving technological landscape all while continuing to produce journalism in an increasingly challenging and hostile political environment.

  "prediction": "From the early 2010s until now, our industry saw the rise of what I’ll call Community Engagement 1.0 — that is, consulting communities about their information needs and genuinely serving our audiences by delivering journalism that fills in those gaps. The earliest explanation of this that I’ve seen is from a 2011 blog post titled “ What does ‘community engagement’ mean? ” by the late  Steve Buttry , former director of student media at Louisiana State University’s Manship School of Mass Communication. Buttry wrote succinctly: “Community engagement = News orgs make top priority to listen, to join, lead &amp; enable conversation to elevate journalism.” That same year,  Joy Mayer , executive director and founder of Trusting News, described in a slide deck that engagement involved knowing more about “why people turn to us, what they want from us, how we can help,” and emphasized that involving our audiences in the journalism we produce makes it “more in touch, more comprehensive, and more present.” Since then, the engagement journalism movement has become increasingly widespread, in part thanks to the popularity of platforms like  GroundSource  and  Hearken  that specialize in supporting newsrooms with this work. Today, media organizations ranging from  neighborhood startups  to  legacy broadcasters  have embraced the practice and integrated it into their news-gathering workflows. All of that is fantastic. And yet. Overall interest in the news is still unequivocally declining. The  Reuters Institute’s 2024 Digital News Report  says that long-term trends in attention loss, news avoidance, and news fatigue suggest the public is becoming more ambivalent about the news — and it’s a global phenomenon impacting countries from Argentina to the U.K. Even more alarming, young people make up a significant proportion of that decline. It’s why, for the past few years, I’ve been obsessed with honing in on what the precise function of news really is in our modern times. Why do we, as journalists, do what we do? What’s our fundamental value? And how do we translate that value to the public in a way that’s clear and accessible? The zenith of venture-backed, pageview-driven media (of which I was a part) in the 2010s diverted the focus of newsroom management towards chasing eyeballs in exchange for digital ad dollars. We veered off course, mistaking volume for value and clicks for connection. Community engagement best practices have tried to rectify that, with more and more newsrooms making a concerted effort to listen to the communities they serve. Even so, though, one nagging question that kept coming up for me was: Do these audiences understand how they can use this information in their daily lives, however tailored it is to them? If there’s one quibble I have with Community Engagement 1.0, it’s that newsrooms employing this approach are still focused on process rather than outcome. It’s understandable, after all, since journalists are historically trained to just focus on the reporting, and not the consequences of their reporting. But that’s no longer cutting it. To be clear, I don’t mean to say that engagement journalists don’t take great care to reduce harm, and gather information from sources through a trauma-informed lens (they do). Rather, I mean that we can be more concerned about what we’re  not  doing than what we are delivering. Enter Community Engagement 2.0, which I describe as leveling up community engagement best practices to encourage the public to move from engaging with the news to engaging with the world — that is, their neighborhood, city, province/state, country — around them. And let’s face it: The world is in survival mode. So journalism at its core should be information that’s useful or user-friendly, that helps people navigate their lives on a daily basis, that helps them make decisions impacting their future, that helps them take action. “Useful” also means focusing less on needlessly anxiety-inducing information that causes paralysis, and instead on concrete solutions that someone can actually take action on. We’re talking brass tacks. “Get in, get out” kind of information. “How do I eat?” kind of information. “Where do I live?” kind of information. At  The Green Line , a hyperlocal information and community services organization I founded in April 2022, engagement  and  action are built into our foundation. Our mandate is to deliver “information you can actually use in your daily life,” and to investigate “the way Torontonians live to report on solutions, actions and resources that help you become happier in our city.” The information we provide aims to not only help people advocate for themselves through voting and other democratic processes so they can effect policy outcomes, but also to support each other through mutual aid. It’s likely not a shock for you to learn that  governments   worldwide  are enacting  funding   cuts  that will result in a reduction in public services, so helping people help themselves will be more than a matter of building character. People may be turning away from the news, but they’re not — nor will they ever — turn away from useful, thoughtfully curated information that helps them do something about their problems, and ultimately improves their lives.

  "headline": "AI adoption matures in small and local newsrooms",
  "summary": "“Why is formalizing AI adoption necessary? Experimentation, while valuable, has its limits.”",
  "prediction": "This past year has been professionally gratifying, as larger local news organizations have begun to take AI adoption seriously. They have refocused internal resources to move beyond mere experimentation, integrating AI-powered products into meaningful workflows. These well-resourced newsrooms now approach AI adoption with the discipline derived from formal product management principles and the software development lifecycle. Looking ahead, I predict that 2025 will mark a turning point for  smaller  local newsrooms with limited resources, as they begin to formalize their approaches to AI product adoption. Why is formalizing AI adoption necessary? Experimentation, while valuable, has its limits. To make a substantive organizational impact, AI must be widely deployed and integrated into journalists’ daily workflows. Achieving this requires addressing several critical questions: How will AI products be supported and maintained? What processes will guide the identification and adoption of new features? And how will the operating expenses be sustainably managed? Fortunately, much of this formalization need not be novel. Most newsrooms already have established processes for technology adoption that predate AI. These frameworks align stakeholders on a problem, determine viable solutions, and implement them effectively. However, generative AI disrupts standard adoption processes by making immensely powerful technologies directly accessible to journalists at large. And they have certainly been experimenting with generative AI, as we saw in  our research published this year . While these efforts are both commendable and necessary, they also reveal a challenge: most journalists lack formal training in product management or the software development lifecycle. News organizations must now work to translate promising experiments into formal products that can be shared responsibly with others. Thankfully, many newsrooms already have the infrastructure to meet this challenge. Local journalists conducting groundbreaking AI experiments should collaborate with colleagues experienced in product development and the software development lifecycle. Together, they can leverage existing processes to formalize the adoption of new AI products, maximizing their chances of success and ensuring they are implemented responsibly within news operations.

  "prediction": "With the dizzying array of content creators, influencers, podcasters, and AI bots flooding the market with information and, many times,  misinformation , consumers are at the very least exhausted and frustrated by the news or at the very worst avoiding news altogether. Although there is increasing distrust in national news, local news outlets — whether legacy or new entrants — continue to attract loyal audiences in their communities. According to a  2024 Pew Research Local News Study , most U.S. adults (85%) believe local news outlets are at least somewhat important to the well-being of their local community, including 44% who say they are extremely or very important. These numbers are encouraging for the local news industry, which continues to meet the challenges posed by the constant stream of disruption it has experienced for more than a decade. As consumers feel overwhelmed by information — or misinformation — overload, the local news industry is seizing the opportunity and providing communities with more news that matters to them. Here’s how they’re doing it. Based on a recent LMC survey, local media is forecasting an increase in 2025 digital revenue led by an uptick in consumer and advertising revenue associated with the continued maturation of video-focused efforts and newsletter engagement strategies. Because of this positive momentum, the Local Media Consortium is bullish on local news and thinks 2025 will be the year local media gets its swagger back.

  "prediction": "I can already imagine the flood of articles we’ll see analyzing the impact of Trump’s second presidency on journalism in the coming years. And I understand the concern — Trump’s return to power will indeed affect journalism, much like any government that seeks to undermine or attack our profession.  But here’s the problem: When we focus only on defending freedom of speech, we risk painting a narrow picture of journalism. Yes, freedom of speech is essential for journalism to thrive, but it is not the only value that defines it. Freedom of speech is a necessary condition, but it is not sufficient for journalism to exist. At its core, journalism is a public service. And like any public service, it cannot truly function without engaging the people it is meant to serve. The outcome of the last U.S. presidential election — and the rise of populist politicians in recent years — offers clear evidence that  journalism is failing to meet the public’s needs . Looking at the growing support for populism, we must ask ourselves: What role has journalism played in this shift? Did we address the issues affecting people who keep supporting populism because they feel that’s their last resource? It’s time to admit that we are not fulfilling our core duty and move beyond our comfortable position of self-proclaimed superiority. We need to start engaging with the public — not just to inform but to listen. We must build diverse communities of readers, extending the limits of our current audiences to reach the people we are failing and pushing towards low-quality information. We need to ask people what they need from us. We need to show them how journalism can be a vital part of their lives, and how paying for news can become something essential rather than optional. Instead of focusing on the threat posed by populist governments, we should focus on the people who elect them. It’s time to shift our attention away from defending the profession and towards serving the public in meaningful ways. Francesco Zaffarano is head of content at  Will Media . "

  "headline": "Young journalists will reimagine a better press",
  "summary": "“The newest generation of journalists will not give in to pessimism about whether their profession still matters in an age of cynicism about the press.”",
  "prediction": "As a journalism professor, I often talk with students about the purpose of journalism in a liberal democracy — which I assume the United States to be, at least aspirationally. I start by explaining what I mean by liberal democracy. It’s a form of governance in which decisions are made based on the will of the people, in furtherance of values such as individual autonomy, equal rights, and justice under law, respect for people’s humanity, and the belief that we have the agency and responsibility to improve our society through  civic participation . Then we talk about why the practice of liberal democracy in the United States matters. It empowers us to achieve the more perfect union that’s envisioned in our Constitution, through the exercise of the five freedoms that are guaranteed  in our First Amendment . I argue that the press is an indispensable civic institution, whose purpose in our democracy is to provide everyone with the information they need to make well-informed decisions about their needs and interests. Of course, this is not an original argument. Political philosophers  such as Thomas Jefferson ,  communication scholars ,  journalism professors , and  journalists themselves  have argued some variation of it for many years. But it’s important to center ourselves in this understanding of purpose, as we think about what’s next for journalism — not only in the coming year, but throughout the rest of the decade. Young journalists, in particular, are deeply concerned about the future. They’re starting their lives in a time of  social ,  political ,  economic ,  climatological , and  technological  disruptions. And they’re starting their careers in a turbulent industry marked by  job precarity ,  an absence of well-being , horrific  harassment , increasing  threats  and  physical danger , and a conscienceless corporate focus  on maximizing profits . One way to cope with instability is to have a strong sense of who you are as a person and what your purpose is in life. Some people find these things in religion, or in other traditions. Others find them in philosophy, or through hardships, or in the company of others who share their life experiences. Wherever you find your sense of purpose and identity, one of the most consequential ways to express it is through your job. Occupations are a means through which we can operationalize who we are and what we value every day. And so, the day after our national elections, with the knowledge that students were processing a range of emotions, I sent them a message to remind them of these things, in the context of journalism in the service of democracy: I’ve told you since the first day of class that journalists have a lot of power. A lot of power. And if you didn’t understand it then, perhaps you do now. Journalists have tremendous power to inform or misinform, to be brutally honest or to slant, to represent or to misrepresent. And these are feelings felt by people across the political spectrum. If you are happy with the way the election turned out , and you want to be a journalist, your job going forward is to report the news fairly, accurately, and transparently, and to hold power accountable. If you are unhappy with the way the election turned out , and you want to be a journalist, your job going forward is to report the news fairly, accurately, and transparently, and to hold power accountable. Notice how your job is the same either way. And that will never change. Journalism is about truthfully reporting on the state of the world and its implications, and holding power accountable. And the positive responses to this that I received from students, faculty, and  journalists themselves  are the basis for the following prediction for journalism. The newest generation of journalists will not give in to pessimism about whether their profession still matters in an age of cynicism about the press. While they understand how journalism has failed our society, they also know that people who are committed to producing journalism in the public interest have the power to help to repair it. They are not naively optimistic. The pandemic and other recent events of historical significance have cured them of much of their innocence. They have a level of anxiety that should impress the members of the acerbic generation once defined in part by  Prozac Nation , who know their clonazepam and citalopram from their fluoxetine and Wellbutrin. Nor should we, as scholars  like Nik Usher warn , romanticize the effects of journalism on our democracy, as many factors influence its health and energy. But experiencing the stings of leadership and policy errors in 21st-century America has led students to pursue callings whose purpose is to ameliorate them. They want to do the work of reimagining journalism to be more relevant and responsive to the needs of their generation and society — and in the coming years, they will. For them, the cause of a press that serves a useful role in U.S. democracy  endures .

  "headline": "The publisher is always right",
  "summary": "“In 2025, unless we come together as a journalism field and course-correct away from information consolidation controlled by the ultra-wealthy, it will get worse.”",
  "prediction": "The business model that sustained newsrooms for the last century is over, and we’re left with the rich buying up newspapers like hometown sports teams. This sort of saviorism isn’t just unacceptable — it’s disastrous. We’ve watched The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, layoff staff in the name of profitability — followed by Bezos himself prompting  250,000 people to unsubscribe  by blocking the publication of a presidential endorsement. We’ve watched members of the L.A. Times editorial board resign because the paper’s billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong,  wouldn’t allow them to publish an editorial  about the stakes of the 2024 election (supposedly because of his concerns about Gaza — something L.A. Times staffers were  punished for late last year  ). And it almost goes without saying, but Rupert Murdoch’s media empire (primarily Fox News) is one of the worst beasts a political system has had the pleasure of dealing with. If we value journalism, more specifically access to credible information, this can’t continue. Unions, newsroom cooperatives, philanthropists, and industry leaders must understand and make clear the gravity of the situation — because simply protecting jobs to maintain what’s left and hope the publisher class won’t make things worse will be the death knell of credibility for the profession. To be fair, publishers with questionable motivations are not new. New York Times owner and publisher Arthur “Punch” Sulzberger was homophobic at a time when coverage of the AIDS crisis needed to be clear and centered on public health. As   his son and successor Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. put it : “The way [gay people] were being treated by being forced to be hidden was antithetical to the values of the company and the values of journalism.” So if this was always the case, what’s different about 2025? One: Newspaper consolidation. That means the editorial whims of one newspaper owner have a much wider impact than they did in years prior. There’s  been a net loss  of over 3,200 newspapers since 2005, according to Northwestern’s Local News Initiative. At the same time, national consolidation means the industry is fragile and insular.  Around 1 in 7  newspaper journalists works at The New York Times, a publicly traded company worth around $9 billion and still run by the Sulzberger-Ochs family. (The current publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, has notably ignored the complaints of  hundreds of writers  around the Times’ coverage of trans people in the U.S.) Two: Newspapers no longer have monopoly control over information — which could be a good thing if not for the oxymoron that’s subsumed the previous system, “privatized public squares.” The most popular “public squares” that exist online — Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok — are anything but public, shaped and led by billionaires with specific political alignments and revenue goals (some of them even purchase newspapers!). This problem is inextricably linked to startup and legacy newspapers. News is shared and in many cases shaped on these platforms. Three: The ultra-wealthy in the U.S. are significantly more removed and less kept in check than prior generations. America’s 700-plus billionaires  own over 50% more wealth  than the lower half of Americans. While inflation and housing stock have made many people millionaires, a  fraction of a fraction of a percent  of Americans have more than $30 million. Relatedly, the effective corporate tax rate has declined steadily since the 1950s, and the tax loopholes individuals with extreme wealth can access are manifest. The political and material realities of people with this much wealth have nothing to do with the average person in the U.S. We’re dealing with the price of eggs, while someone like Jeff Bezos might deal with not just the farm, but also the company that builds the tractors, the facilities that process the animal feed, and the trucking company that keeps the eggs cold in transit to your local supermarket. It’s not so much a prediction as a necessity: We must abandon publications and platforms that fail to center our values in favor of newsrooms that actually care for us, our families, our neighbors, and our future. We are living in a system where our information needs are increasingly being sidelined due to shrinking newsrooms. What we’re left with now is a false choice: Many of the newspapers and platforms that remain are run at the behest of people with a minimal understanding of and interest in the success of our day to day lives. While I don’t have faith in most of them, billionaire newspaper owners still have the opportunity to do better and I welcome them to support new models for information and journalism focused on models not shaped by their immediate political interests. Whether the future is stronger union-run newsrooms or news cooperatives or nonprofits or even significantly more government investment in news, I won’t prescribe. But I do know one thing: In 2025, unless we come together as a journalism field and course-correct away from information consolidation controlled by the ultra-wealthy, it will get worse.

  "summary": "“Somewhere in the future, beyond 2025, a flourishing landscape of adequately financed, equitable media enterprises will deliver impactful content, serve diverse communities, and achieve financial independence.”",
  "prediction": "2024 was the year when the industry finally admitted that silver-bullet revenue solutions don’t exist. Advertising alone isn’t enough, membership models are promising but require scale and resources, and philanthropic giving — while growing — is finite. And so we’ve seen the rise in Europe of media-adjacent businesses. We’ve been delivered remarkable case studies in the form of the  Manchester Mill’s growing direct relationship business ,  Zetland’s translation tools and expansion into Finland ,  the Meal Planning media business in Romania , Awe Marketplace ( an alternative, cross-continent advertising ecosystem ), and  Mensagem de Lisboa’s local community-focused newsroom . The journalism support industry has shifted in response through (relatively) new players such as  Reference Circle , the  Solutions Journalism Network ,  Media Forward Fund , and  Report for the World  in order to try and share and catalyze these ideas. But despite all these remarkable case studies and support programs, one critical question remains unanswered: Where is the capital to help journalism organizations start, survive, and thrive? Because without it, even the brightest initiatives risk fizzling out before they can fulfil their promise. Startup capital is not just an enabler — it’s a multiplier. Even small injections of capital can be transformative, providing organizations with the freedom to experiment, hire talent, and develop the products and services needed to grow sustainably. While philanthropy and the European Commission has addressed some of this need over the past decade, it’s not enough. The demand far outstrips the supply. Bootstrapping is of course possible, but not ideal. When even pioneering, beloved newsrooms like Decât o Revistă,  which ceased activity in 2023 , struggle to make ends meet, we need to pay attention. No, to scale innovative solutions and address the deepening crisis in quality and local journalism, access to new sources of start-up or seed funding is essential. It’s 2025. Impact investment has entered the chat. When I talk to journalists, they bemoan the lack of capital. But when I talk to investors, they bemoan the dearth of investment-worthy media businesses. Impact investment is the allocation of capital to organizations or projects that aim to deliver measurable social or environmental benefits alongside modest financial returns. The potential upside, as folks with money like to say, is huge. Impact investors have transformed sectors like cleantech, where innovative financing models have turned what once seemed impossible into billion-euro opportunities (the EU saw €16.7 billion invested in cleantech in Q1 of 2024 alone). What if journalism could unlock even a fraction of this? This year, I helped to secure three impact investments for organizations I’m advising. But it was far from easy. That journey helped me understand that the issues are as much with the demand, as they are the supply. Impact investment has largely avoided journalism up to this point because, let’s be honest: Attracting investors to journalism isn’t easy. Media is often seen as high-risk and tough-to-scale with uncertain returns. There’s limited data on successful exits, and the sector’s societal value is poorly understood by traditional investors (or poorly communicated by journalists). Journalism is viewed as an uninvestable niche information product rather than an essential public service. On top of that, the financing models rarely fit the unique challenges of media organizations and products, where the value is long-term and intangible. My prediction for 2025 is that this will change. Great work from organizations like  V-Ventures ,  Karma Capital , and Media Development Investment Fund (especially with their  media impact bond collaboration with Pluralis &amp; GLS Bank ), has already begun to turn systemic barriers to media investment into new opportunities without cannibalizing existing capital. I predict we’ll see more dedicated funds providing diverse early-stage capital to media entrepreneurs, particularly those from historically underserved communities. I predict the emergence of more impact-focused angel investors, venture funds, and intermediaries supporting purpose-driven media. I predict new networks channelling expertise from seemingly adjacent sectors like climate justice and social housing into journalism, building trust and capacity. I predict alternative deal structures — such as revenue-based financing, outcome-based financing, equity grants, concessionary loans, and even community impact bonds, will offer flexible pathways to growth. The demand side of this equation — creating investable media businesses — will also evolve significantly in 2025. We will see more media organizations embracing hybrid profit-and-purpose structures like B Corporation status. Inclusive leadership initiatives will further reshape the media landscape, proving that diverse teams attract audiences and investors alike. Media organizations will master the art of storytelling—not just in their content, but in presenting their value proposition to funders. Clear benchmarks tied to Sustainable Development Goals, democracy, and community engagement will give investors the confidence they’ve been waiting for (perhaps using the brilliant new  Civic Information Index  to do so). The path is not without challenges. Balancing societal benefits with financial targets is difficult, and media organizations require greater capacity-building to develop the acumen needed to succeed. Investors often expect returns of 5% to 7%, balanced with significant social impact, placing pressure on journalism non-profits to build the revenue models and attract the talent to deliver both. Journalists and investors must resist the pressure to only think in terms of bigger, faster, or more — investment cannot come at the expense of communities or editorial standards. Real growth happens when we prioritize sustaining meaningful relationships and transferring knowledge over chasing scale for its own sake. (Sidebar: My most popular YouTube video this year  was about degrowth in journalism.) If we can overcome these challenges, 2025 will be the year impact investment finally enters the conversation around journalism sustainability in a meaningful way — just as we’ve seen with philanthropy over the past decade. The result? Somewhere in the future, beyond 2025, a flourishing landscape of adequately financed, equitable media enterprises will deliver impactful content, serve diverse communities, and achieve financial independence. Media investment will no longer be seen as high-risk but as a vital pillar for democracy and inclusion. Together, investors and founders will unlock new capital by proving that mission-driven journalism isn’t just a worthy cause — it’s something to invest in.

  "headline": "Divergent paths for journalism’s future with AI",
  "summary": "“The theories of AI as a substituting force or complementary force in the labor market provide a way to chart the choices ahead.”",
  "prediction": "When it comes to AI, journalism as a profession seems to be caught between the extremes of hope and disillusionment. Attitudes on the role and  impact of AI on journalism  tend to veer from fears about robots replacing journalists to hopes that machines could boost quality journalism. The media industry is at a critical juncture in its relationship with artificial intelligence, especially generative AI. The coming year is likely to see a significant divergence in how news organizations approach AI with two distinct choices between substituting or complementing journalists. The theories of AI as a substituting force or complementary force in the labor market provide a way to chart the choices ahead. The substituting force refers to the phenomenon where technological advancements or new work practices  replace or reduce the need for certain types of labor . Consider the now obsolete job of the elevator operator. The substituting path envisions AI as a replacement for human journalists. This scenario is already unfolding in some areas of journalism, with news agencies using AI to generate stories once performed by entry-level journalists. In the U.K., the Press Association already integrates non-generative AI into its wire service with products like RADAR. It enabled a team of five journalists to file more than  400,000 local news stories  in the three years since its 2018 launch. More recently, there have been AI-generated presenters, with the U.K.’s third-largest regional media group National World  debuting its AI weather presenter  in 2023. With AI rapidly developing, this trend could potentially extend to more complex journalistic tasks, such as creating AI-generated podcasts like  Discover Daily  by Perplexity. The complementary force, on the other hand, occurs when the same changes in technology or work increase the demand for certain types of labor by complementing existing skills. For example, the rise of  data and computational journalists  in the newsroom over the past decade. In the scenario, AI assists journalists by handling time-consuming tasks like data analysis, fact-checking, and transcription. For example, the Associated Press has developed a tool to search and filter posts on local government websites from across the US, looking for news tips. In the U.K., the BBC is testing  AI-generated story graphics  to reversion existing BBC news for a younger audience on social media. The choice between these paths is not binary, and the future lies somewhere in between. It is reminiscent of the early 2000s and 2010s when the internet and social media were either going to save journalism and foster a more democratic media, or create a dystopian era where clickbait flourished and viral falsehoods spread. The reality between these extremes has ebbed and flowed over the past two decades. There is no doubt that the direction taken with AI will significantly shape the future of journalism. The substitution path holds the lure of efficiencies, reduced costs, and savings at scale. The complementary path, while preserving more human jobs, would require a focus on public interest rather than profit-driven journalism. As the news industry faces continued political, economic, and societal pressures, 2025 looks set to be a year of reckoning for AI and journalism.

  "author": "Alexandra Borchardt",
  "headline": "Newsrooms reinvent their political journalism",
  "summary": "“What if reporting on racist, misogynist, dehumanizing opinions and comments has the opposite effect from what most journalists intend — normalizing propaganda and even making political candidates seem interesting?”",
  "prediction": "In traditional newsrooms, political journalists tend to be those who call the shots. Even in the absence of statistics, it’s safe to bet that the majority of editors-in-chief used to cover politics before rising to the top job. This has shaped pretty much all of journalism. The “he said, she said” variety of news coverage that makes for a large part of political reporting has pervaded other subject areas as well. The attempt to give opposing parties a voice led to the so-called “both-sides journalism” which operates under the assumption that on the marketplace of ideas and opinions those will survive that serve the people best. But the past few years have already demonstrated that this kind of journalism is not sustainable. First and foremost, it doesn’t serve humanity well in the case of imminent and severe threats like climate change or attacks on democratic institutions where bothsidesism is not an option. Also, newsroom metrics have shown again and again that audiences tend to be put off by news content that just amplifies opinions and intentions of decision makers without linking it to people’s lives. News avoidance is real and has been growing. The result of the 2024 U.S. election and the rise of authoritarian leaning extremists in other democracies should have served as the final wakeup call for political journalism. What if the media’s calling out those who don’t respect democracy and its institutions doesn’t deter people from voting exactly those politicians into office? What if reporting on racist, misogynist, dehumanizing opinions and comments has the opposite effect from what most journalists intend — normalizing propaganda and even making political candidates seem interesting? And what if newsrooms who complain about political polarization have contributed their fair share to it themselves? Polarization has been a successful business model for journalism after all. These are hard questions that demand answers. If they want to stay relevant in serving the public, newsrooms will have to double down on studying the impact of their political journalism and think about consequences. Otherwise, they will continue to preach to the converted and fail in their mission to inform people about real threats to their livelihoods. While there is no quick recipe to disrupt and reinvent political journalism, some of the following ingredients might help to develop an strategy and improve the result: First, studying human behavior . There is plenty of research and evidence out there on how propaganda works, how those in or aspiring to power use the media to amplify it, and how people react to it. If journalists don’t want to be tools in the hands of those ready to abolish press freedom and erode democratic institutions, they better familiarize themselves with these mechanisms. Insights from communication and behavioral psychology should be part of all journalism education and shape newsroom debates. It has become obvious that values and emotions like a sense of justice, pride, shame, and fear shape people’s voting decisions often more than rational choice theory would suggest. Newsrooms must account for that. Second, chasing data, not just quotes . For political journalists, quotes are data, for other people not so much. They deserve to know what happened, not what someone says they might want to see happening or intends to make happen once in power. Data journalism — increasingly improved by the capabilities of artificial intelligence — provides plenty of opportunities to paint pictures of the real world instead of the world of intentions and declarations. Political journalism can be more interesting when people see how politicians have actually performed in contexts where they were responsible. Needless to say that data journalism needs to be made engaging to appeal to a variety of audiences. Third, connecting reporting to people’s everyday lives . Politicians have an agenda and journalists are often swayed by it; people are likely to have different ones. Observers might have been baffled that voters didn’t give the Biden administration credit for the strong state of the American economy, but apparently all many people saw before casting their vote was their rising cost of living. Most people care deeply about issues like housing, personal security, the education of their children, health, and care for aging relatives. Only, most of these issues are linked to citizens’ immediate surroundings, their communities. Unsurprisingly, local news tops the list of interests in all age groups when asked for their journalism preferences, as the  2024 Digital News Report  revealed. But with diminishing investment in local journalism, many of these topics have been under covered in recent years. A disconnect between political journalism and people’s lives has emerged that needs to be remedied. Fourth, choosing appropriate formats . Modern newsrooms target different audiences with different formats on the platforms these audiences engage with. Political journalism is still too focused on the audiences that they have traditionally served. It is often made for well-educated groups and decision makers. If newsrooms really want to reach people beyond the community of like-minded news consumers, they need to explore how these audiences can be attracted. There are  high hopes in the industry  that artificial intelligence can assist in making journalism more appealing and inclusive by transcending formats — converting content to text, video, audio, interactive chat, or even graphic novel by the push of a button. It is too early to tell how this will affect news consumption and audience figures in the real world, but many media leaders expect opportunities for stronger news uptake. Fifth, learning from other fields of journalism . Political journalists tend to be aware of their importance in the internal hierarchy. Many of them feel proud to do “the real thing” instead of covering entertainment, sports, personal finance, and the like. This might help them to digest the fact that colleagues in other fields score higher in the audience metrics department. But it’s exactly these colleagues political journalists could learn from to improve their own game. They could ask the science desk how to best deal with data and how to break down complex matters in digestible formats. They might get some advice on humanizing stories from those reporting on sports or celebrities. They could learn from investigative reporters how to pace oneself when seemingly sensational material is at hand and how to cooperate with others. And they could practice churning out one or the other service story. In fact, the whole newsroom should be interested in improving political journalism, since at times politics is part of most subject matters. If journalism wants to maintain its legitimacy, relevance, and impact — particularly in an age when artificial intelligence will make content production ubiquitous — it needs to urgently rethink political journalism. Making it appealing to broader audiences and attracting them to engage with it might be no less than a matter of its survival. Many media leaders are aware of this. Chances are that in 2025 newsrooms will finally rethink the paradigm of political journalism. Alexandra Borchardt  is a Germany-based independent media researcher. "

  "summary": "“Many publishers remain anchored to hierarchies born in the print era, with editorial at the center and product and technology bolted on as afterthoughts.”",
  "prediction": "When readers encounter clunky apps, disjointed digital experiences, or headlines optimized for clicks rather than clarity, they’re experiencing something deeper than bad design. These flaws reveal the structural cracks within modern newsrooms — the tension between their form and their function. Having tried almost everything else, I think 2025 is when publishers start to address their structural issues. Frank Lloyd Wright once said: “Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union.” For newsrooms, this can’t continue to be an aspiration — it needs to become a reality. In 2025, editorial teams can no longer operate in silos while product, engineering, UX, and insight teams work in parallel but disconnected spaces. To thrive, publishers need a seamless union between these roles, where expertise, priorities, and goals don’t just coexist but actively enhance one another. For too long, newsrooms have been structured for an era that no longer exists, and their products reflect this mismatch. The solution isn’t simply better tools or larger budgets. It’s about reimagining the newsroom as a cohesive, adaptive system. The result won’t just be happier staff and smoother workflows — it will mean a radically improved experience for readers and a more sustainable future for journalism. Look under the hood of most news organizations, and you’ll find a tangle of competing priorities and overlapping responsibilities. Editorial teams focus on the craft of storytelling, while product teams treat journalism as a user experience challenge. Engineers wrestle with aging tech stacks as insight teams battle fragmented data. Each group may excel in isolation, but collectively, the result is often disjointed — and readers notice. The problem lies in structure. Many publishers remain anchored to hierarchies born in the print era, with editorial at the center and product and technology bolted on as afterthoughts. This legacy design fosters inefficiency, slows innovation, and breeds internal competition where there should be collaboration. What would a more functional newsroom look like? Well you will have heard this all before — but I think we’re finally ready to get more serious about it: We need to get comfortable that the future doesn’t look like the past. Profound transformation is needed so that readers encounter products that feel seamless, engaging, and intuitive. In an era of declining trust and intensifying competition for attention, these changes aren’t just helpful — they’re existential. The publishers that thrive in the years ahead will be those that invest in structural alignment, not just new technology or flashy tools. Of course, this kind of transformation comes with challenges. Breaking down silos means rethinking hierarchies, revising workflows, and navigating cultural resistance. But the payoff is undeniable: smoother processes, faster innovation, and products that genuinely serve readers. It will take bold leadership, uncomfortable conversations, and a willingness to let go of legacy thinking. But the reward is worth it: a future where journalism moves out of defense mode and starts proactively building and shaping what happens next. Nick Petrie  is digital director at  The i Paper . "

  "headline": "AI inspires innovation in journalism education",
  "summary": "“It will be the educators’ job to direct students in the most effective ways to use AI to extend their capabilities, not replace them.”",
  "prediction": "Ten years ago, I submitted my first Nieman Lab prediction, in which I made the provocation that  product management would be the new model for journalism . I am encouraged by the thriving  news product community  that has emerged over the past decade. However, journalism education, with few exceptions, has not comprehensively responded to support this digital product shift. But I predict that journalism education will experience a new era of innovation due to the continued adoption of and experimentation with artificial intelligence applications. While many lament the possibilities for AI to replace both journalists and educators, I feel that there are approaches to AI that can achieve improved outcomes for both teachers and learners. Adding the newest technology into curriculum takes motivation, commitment, and time. Many recognize the deficiencies in traditional journalism curriculum but feel overwhelmed by or not empowered to embark on innovation. AI can reduce the effort it takes to assess, learn, and apply new technologies and emerging concepts, from adding modules to an existing course, to developing new courses based on current programming languages or applications, to undertaking full-scale curriculum redesign. Not only can it provide customized code samples for programming exercises or step-by-step descriptions of new software features, it can assist with syllabi and course development, contextualize explanations of difficult concepts and organize them into course modules and presentations. And it can suggest recommendations for degree plans and curriculum modifications that could result in more adaptable programs that are more responsive to student career outcomes (you are on your own with getting changes approved by your curriculum committees, though). Helping students through their own learning process, particularly for technology training, takes more time and heavy doses of patience. AI can provide support for students in their own learning process. For example, in my Mobile App Development course, I used ChatGPT to learn and update examples using the newest version of the Swift programming language. Then I added lessons encouraging students to use AI in developing their own projects. The quality of the code created, as well as the explanations provided by the AI platform, greatly reduced students’ apprehension and stress. Students were better able to achieve their project visions, and I enjoyed the support of an AI teaching assistant that could help students with troubleshooting and coding errors. Students also exercised judgment with the post-exercise reflections discussing their approaches to prompting and the quality of the work they created with the assistance of AI. In addition to learning new technologies, AI can increase students’ confidence in traditional skills. In my graduate Digital Issues course, students are assigned readings and weekly posts on digital media theory, cyberculture research, data journalism, social media, immersive media, and law and policy issues. Toward the end of the semester, I became aware of the Google product  NotebookLM , uploaded my last nine years of Nieman Lab predictions and had it  generate a podcast  with two realistically human sounding “hosts” talking about my articles. I was blown away by what it produced and more than a bit impressed by how it engaged with my work. I couldn’t wait to give students a chance to try it. I had them upload links to each of their posts and generate their own AI podcasts. Student reflections indicated that hearing the “hosts” engage with their writing and ideas gave them more confidence in what they had created. They were also able to critique what did and did not work well in the AI-generated conversations. One of the exercises in my undergraduate Digital Media Innovation Capstone course involved guiding students through a lean canvas exercise. The lean canvas is a tool that explores an innovative concept or idea, providing a format for identifying the problem statement, customer segments, value proposition, distribution channels, and financial considerations. After we completed the exercise, I introduced them to  ZigZag , a web-based, AI tool that creates a lean canvas based on a single prompt. I asked students to compare the AI-created canvas to what they had created. Their comments included that the AI version was more comprehensive and gave them more creative ways to consider the problem they were addressing. They also indicated limitations, including the often non-specific nature and impersonal tone of AI-generated output. In addition to the canvas, ZigZag also provided sample questions for empathy interviews, elevator pitch suggestions, potential startup names, and even sample code for a simple landing page (which happens to be our final project). When used effectively, students found that this tool could help validate a concept and recommend new directions and ideas, all part of the innovation process. Some may wonder if we’ll actually need teachers in the future, with AI providing such high-quality instruction, constant availability, and seemingly limitless patience. But with the fast pace of change and the volume of potential topics and concepts to be learned, the role of educator will shift to become more that of curator and coach, guiding students toward the topics and approaches that will be most useful to them in the future and inspiring confidence in their ability to learn and apply them to the problems they wish to solve. The educator will also model and encourage the critical thinking and ethical considerations necessary to judge the quality of AI output and how to best integrate it with the human element. In these examples, which are but a few of the ways in which AI can be integrated into journalism curricula, the AI tools pushed students outside their comfort zones to achieve project goals, gain confidence in their work, validate ideas, and critique their output. And it provided an agency for them to do so on their own, a self-sufficiency that should serve them well as they navigate careers in which lifelong learning will be required. It will be the educators’ job to direct students in the most effective ways to use AI to extend their capabilities, not replace them. We are just at the beginning of understanding the application of AI in educational environments. The tools will get better, the outputs will become more realistic and the shifting nature of the human emphasis will need to be continuously reevaluated and appreciated. But I, for one, welcome our AI overlords in inspiring a new era of innovation in journalism education.

  "author": "Jessica Maddox",
  "headline": "Influencers become journalists",
  "summary": "“Joe Rogan is a symptom of changing media systems, not the root cause.”",
  "prediction": "Last year here, I  predicted  TV reporters would become influencers. I asserted that in being encouraged by stations to use social media to build brands and bring in viewership, reporters would experience something we call  influencer creep  — how being on social mandates one act like an influencer, even if they don’t necessarily think of themselves that way. However, this year, I predict the convergence in the opposite direction: Influencers become journalists. In a way, my statement is misleading, because many influencers are already journalists. A November 2024 Pew Research Center  study  found 21% of U.S. adults rely on news influencers for information, with many  saying  online creators “helped them better understand current events and civic issues.” This is consistent with existing research that found that earlier in 2024, over half of U.S. adults (54%) said they at least sometimes got  news  from social media. The signs were there — but very few were listening, clinging to outdated understandings of not just news, but the power of social media influencers. Before the dust had even settled over the results of the U.S. presidential election, finger pointing began. Influencers had been a hot topic of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, but their impact had been gravely misjudged. Instead of trying to understand  why  the Democratic National Committee had  invited  over 200 TikTokkers and YouTubers to its convention, including those who never talked politics on their accounts, there was scoffing and  backlash . But then, with scores shocked at the re-election of Donald Trump, many finally realized they had been overlooking influencers’ power. An influencer can’t  make  anyone think anything. But those who study internet culture, fandom, parasocial relationships, sociology, and more can tell you why influencers were such  successful  communication disseminators during the 2024 U.S. Election. For instance, take the Joe Rogan podcast. Rogan’s podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, consistently ranks as one of the most  listened  to podcasts in the United States. Rogan, a comedian and UFC color commentator, has become a paragon for young and middle-aged men across America. And he works because the bulk of his three-hour long podcast episodes  aren’t  explicitly political. Rogan “shoots the shit” with this audience, makes jokes, smokes marijuana, and then maybe starts pontificating on how he has vaccine skepticism, or how he doesn’t have to be mindful of sensitive language on his own podcast. Sure, he hosts politicians and controversial figures, but Rogan largely offers his audience of young men a place where they can feel emboldened. Rogan is an influencer, and he’s primarily influencing a lifestyle — and if political mobilization and information comes along with it, so be it. The same thing can be said of influencers who are trad wives, homestead, or promote “quiet luxury” — it’s all about  selling  a feeling or a type of wistfulness, albeit a problematic one. The lure of the trad wives and homesteaders to break free of the pressures of modern life can be enticing, but nostalgia is almost always regressive. Selling lifestyles may appear to just be selling aesthetics, but it also is about the beliefs, practices, and information that come with it. Whether it’s long-form content, like Joe Rogan’s podcast, or short-form TikTok videos with influencers doing their makeup or making bread from scratch while talking about a political issue, the casual, intimate conversation style of social media makes individuals feel as if they’re seen, even if the content is directed to the masses. This is why a common  refrain  of the last few weeks to “find a leftist Rogan” is shortsighted. It puts the cart before the horse, and it doesn’t understand Joe Rogan is a symptom of changing media systems, not the root cause. And to their credit, the Democratic National Committee tried this strategy with inviting creators to the DNC — and were ridiculed for it. But I can hear the critiques now:  These are influencers, not journalists . But as media industries have converged across the broad, we must rethink our understanding of how individuals get and receive information. We must think about how the lines between entertainment and information continue to blur at problematic and rapid rates. It’s not simply about watching the nightly news, or labeling something mis-or-disinformation. Journalists are influencers, and influencers are journalists, but if that’s hard to swallow, think of them as op-ed writers or cultural commentators. Content creators and influencers are doorways to information and ideas, and our volatile political and media landscape make its enticing for audiences to walk through them.

  "headline": "Communities relearn the habits of local news",
  "summary": "“If you’d been elected to some local position in the past year, my call was probably your first time ever dealing with a journalist. That had never been true in my past jobs.”",
  "prediction": "One of the things that’s lost when the last reporter is laid off and a local newspaper stops publishing is a sort of community muscle memory. In May 2023, I started as the editor of  Brookline.News , a startup, nonprofit news site in Brookline, Massachusetts. It had been about a year since the long-time local newspaper here, the Brookline Tab, stopped publishing. As I started covering the town, there was one major difference from my past reporting gigs at well-established local newspapers and D.C. policy outlets which was immediately apparent: people had fallen out of the habit of dealing with the press. Local officials, like school committee members, were surprised to see me at a meeting or get my call. There was a sense of wariness that I dealt with at every step along the way. Part of that was probably because we were new and hadn’t yet established trust. But at the same time, if you’d been elected to some local position in the past year, my call was probably your first time ever dealing with a journalist. That had never been true in my past jobs. Readers were uncertain too. Frankly, there are people in town who had gotten used to Brookline being a news desert, and took some convincing that it added anything to their lives to check one more website or newsletter every day. I also worried (and still worry) about another kind of muscle memory. When people have gotten used to getting their news from free sources, like social media, it’s hard to convince them to start paying again. And one of our founding principles is to always be free to read for all. So our fundraising team has a difficult needle to thread: Supporting your local news outlet financially is not mandatory, and it’s not something you’ve been doing for a while, but we need it to survive. The good news, and where my optimistic prediction comes from, is that I have seen first-hand that it’s possible to change these dynamics and start to reverse the loss of muscle memory. After 18 months of publishing, we’re having success at reminding people how helpful and valuable it is to have and read reliable local news. Our conversations with sources sound pretty different from when we first started. And our fundraising is going well, leading with the message that just like any nonprofit, philanthropy is key to our growth and success. To be clear, if news outlets only rely on muscle memory and continue doing things exactly as they always did, they will not survive or thrive. But many of the basic rhythms are important to re-establish. Government officials should expect to be questioned about their decisions, and residents need to be better informed about what goes on in their towns and neighborhoods. It happens at different paces in communities with disparate situations, and the losses are felt more deeply in some places than others. But I believe strongly that communities can and will relearn the habits of local news. Sam Mintz  is founding editor of  Brookline.News . "

  "prediction": "We’ve seen a swathe of print magazine launches, relaunches and frequency increases this year, leading to the general acceptance that there is something of a print revival. This has generally been confined to magazines as readers turn to trusted expertise and seek physical reading experiences. There’s no question daily newspapers will continue their decline, but I believe there’s a real opportunity for news in a printed form in 2025. Whether this is weekly roundups like many newspapers already produce with weekend-style editions, monthly Economist-type deep dives or even a more magazine-like format such as The Week. A “finishable” print product from a trusted source which takes the time to explain and consider news would be right for the growing wave of news avoiders who are overwhelmed by the 24/7 news cycle, and offer a way to stay up to date without the existential dread that digital news provokes. It’s not that these products don’t already exist. More that the time is right for those publications to capitalize on industry trends and actually market them, rather than having print tucked away on subscription pages.

  "summary": "“A great deal of language that looks a lot like Christian Nationalism isn’t actually calling for theocracy; it is secular minoritarianism pushed by secular people, often linked to rightwing cable and other media with zero meaningful ties to the church or theological principle.”",
  "prediction": "Despite Donald Trump’s  repeated insistence  during the 2024 election that he knew nothing of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and was not planning on implementing any of its suggestions ( even noting  that some of its claims were “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal”), the Trump transition has tapped a number of people  linked to Project 2025  to serve in the incoming administration. Trump’s choice to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Russell T. Vought, was a key architect of Project 2025. His presence doesn’t just speak to the influence that Project 2025 boosters can expect to enjoy during Trump’s second term. His appointment to the OMB also serves as a harbinger of the kind of religious rhetoric that is likely to suffuse the White House and the overall MAGA media landscape in 2025. In private, Vought has  stated the need  to “rehabilitate Christian Nationalism.” In public, he has claimed that American “rights and duties”  come from God . The think tank he heads, called the Center for Renewing America,  drafted memos  in early 2024 prioritizing a Christian nationalist agenda. Project 2025 employs similar rhetoric,  emphasizing the centrality  of Christianity to US policy and governance. Much of what Vought says, and what Project 2025 echoes, aligns with the rhetoric of the New Apostolic Revolution, a  far-right religious movement  that has ties to the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol and seeks to  enshrine biblical principle  in US law. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has a flag associated with the NAR  hanging outside  his congressional office. There will, for very good reason, be a great deal of news coverage dedicated to the religious rhetoric employed by Vought and other Project 2025 contributors in and around the Trump Administration — including the rhetorical and policy overlaps between groups like the NAR and high-profile politicians like Speaker Johnson. What journalists, academics, and cultural critics can  expect  of religious rhetoric in 2025 dovetails into what should be  done  about that rhetoric. Put very simply, commentators should not assume that religious-sounding language coming from Trump’s orbit is conventionally religious. Conversely, commentators should not assume that secular-sounding language coming from the Trump orbit is conventionally secular. To tackle the first half of that assertion, a great deal of language that looks a lot like Christian Nationalism  isn’t actually calling for theocracy ; it is secular minoritarianism pushed by secular people, often linked to rightwing cable and other media with zero meaningful ties to the church or theological principle. Even when the language is ostensibly advocating for biblically grounded governance, very basic assumptions about what the language means need closer interrogation. Most critical is the assumption that Christian-inflected proclamations about the need to protect the family, Christianity, and America center on love of God and the related desire to spread the Christian faith. What I show in my  forthcoming book  with Mark Brockway is that this language often centers, instead, on hatred of an amalgamated, shape-shifting, ultimately invented  liberal devil  that maps, as convenient, onto “the left,” the Democratic Party, “elites” somehow aligned with Marxism, and what Project 2025 describes as “the Great Awokening.” Spreading the Christian faith isn’t the point; fighting the liberal devil is. This devil is ultimately secular, based on things like DEI initiatives and the existence of trans people, and is also the  quasi-religious antagonist  in a decades-old cosmic showdown between the ultimate good of “real” America and the ultimate evil of leftists hell-bent on tearing it asunder. The centrality of the liberal devil, often  explicitly couched  in the  language  of  evil ,  Satan , and  demons , is what undercuts the equally inaccurate assumption that secular-sounding language targeting “the  woke / radical  left” or “ transgender ideology ” or, to quote Russell Vought, “ a woke and weaponized ” federal government is indeed wholly secular. These denunciations follow the same rhetorical pattern and contain the same apocalyptic fervor as those draped in the rhetoric of religion. The liberal devil is the same; the difference is whether people are using the word God to talk about it. Attacks on the liberal devil — which can just as easily be directed against conservatives and Christians who run afoul of MAGA — is another trend we can expect to continue into 2025 and beyond. We will not be able to respond appropriately or fully appreciate the  Battle of Revelation Lite  being waged on Donald Trump’s behalf if we remain stuck in a binary position of religious  or  secular belief, religious  or  secular speech. What is happening, and will keep happening, is something else entirely. We need to start describing it as such.

  "headline": "Newsroom planning goes silo-free",
  "summary": "“The key is inviting everyone who touches a story from beginning to end to be a part of the conversation.”",
  "prediction": "For an industry rooted in communication, journalists working in newsrooms must improve how they communicate with each other. Is news in its current state reaching the right audiences?  Some reports  would lead us to say no. That’s why, in 2025, news organizations need to put the “why” back in journalism decision-making. We must have an honest, critical look at our work. We need to go back to basics and ask questions like: It’s strategic content planning. At its best, it’s done in a forum that allows stakeholders — from ideation to distribution — to weigh in. This does not mean adding another meeting to everyone’s calendars. Maybe it’s an email or a Slack channel for coordination. The exact approach will differ from newsroom to newsroom. The key is inviting everyone who touches a story from beginning to end to be a part of the conversation. Yes, that means there could be more than one or two people making decisions on a story. Add breaking news to the mix, and there’s a reasonable concern of slowing down your news operation. On the other hand, operating in silos will also slow down newsrooms’ abilities to innovate and ultimately set up a news product that serves not only the audience of today but the audience of tomorrow. So we might as well take a beat and try to get it right. The sooner this strategic planning becomes a part of a newsroom’s culture, the sooner we get smarter about making an efficient process to meet as many needs as possible. Get comfortable with bringing more voices into your trusted circle. Their perspectives are valuable and will lead you to smarter decisions with greater impact. Should this story be a video or a written article? Does this illustration make sense? Get comfortable with making the case to your colleagues. Defend your thinking. Why do we do what we do? Because we’ve always done it this way is not a good answer. Get comfortable with helping funnel information to the people who need it, when they need it and where they need it. It will become a part of your DNA. We also get comfortable with the idea that we might not get it right on the first try either. That’s OK. Document it. What worked? What didn’t? Figure out what needs to change and try that the next time. Let’s not forget our product and business partners, either. At the end of the day, we all want the same thing, right? An audience that sees value and relevance in the work we do. We can’t afford to have good journalism go unnoticed. We can’t do this alone, nor should we. We need each other — and our audiences, too.

  "summary": "“Going into 2025, we need an industry-wide assessment of how our value chain functions because technical and regulatory forces will conspire to make our strategic position less defensible.”",
  "prediction": "In the year ahead, publishers will need to spend a lot more time thinking about their digital infrastructure.  Most newsrooms don’t spend a lot of time thinking about their value chain, a business school concept that tries to explain all the activities and processes that go into creating a product or service. A value chain analysis attempts to explain how companies create defensible strategic advantages by categorizing all the components that lead to a company’s finished product. A value chain for news would start with the reporters and producers who find stories on their beat. It would include the editors who refine that work and the digital producers who package it for distribution. It would include the business side teams who sell subscriptions and advertising. But it would also include external actors like the social networks and search engines that help audiences find news relevant to them. A high-achieving MBA student (and anyone who’s worked in news for the last 15 years) might note that those external parties have gradually “captured” more value by disrupting how news is discovered and distributed: Search engines and social media platforms have won strategic leverage and profit from media companies by training audiences to seek out news in their ecosystem, rather than through publishers’ owned and operated channels. Going into 2025, we need an industry-wide assessment of how our value chain functions because technical and regulatory forces will conspire to make our strategic position less defensible. The Republican vision for Donald Trump’s second term  includes rolling back Section 230 and making it easier for investigators to seize phone records and emails from journalists. Both of those proposals would accelerate the  transformation of the internet into a splinternet —a collection of networks where access to information varies depending on where you are. Digital distribution is already fragmented; it will only become more so if digital infrastructure companies lose their liability shield. Without the protections of Section 230, hosting companies might think twice about working with aggressive investigative news outlets because of the risk of SLAPP suits from powerful interests. Search engines might be pressured to change how their algorithms rank relevant information.  News leaders won’t just need to wrestle with how changing search and social algorithms impact news discovery: They’ll need to make choices about where their data is hosted and what service providers they use for fundamental operations. News organizations could go offline if their CDN provider or host decides that delivering news isn’t worth the cost of becoming a regulatory target. This kind of analysis will be especially important for publishers who start deploying AI products. Right now, we have too much focus on deploying AI solutions that are a light wrapper around a commercially available API — basically providing an easy way for journalists to use ChatGPT from within their CMS. To create strategically resonant AI tools, we’ll need innovators willing to leverage fine-tuning or some other investment to build a more valuable solution. Without that, our AI products won’t accrue any “value,” they’ll just let companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic squeeze publishers more. Developing a deep understanding of what drives the news business will be essential to keeping our newsrooms sustainable. Building a systemic picture of how we connect with — and make money from—our audiences will let us make smart choices about how we prioritize new initiatives. All of this will be a lot to keep track of: Small newsrooms and independent journalists will suffer the most. Big organizations will need to break down silos so editors and executives benefit from the expertise of technical teams. But amidst this turmoil, there will be winners. Outlets that spend the time to understand the shifting value chain will have a chance to transform risk into opportunity. Sam Guzik  leads product strategy for WNYC. "

The people I’ve seen experiment with AI so far, including those in my  programs , are not doing so recklessly. They believe in ethics (transparency, human in the loop). They use caution, building tools and processes that increase newsroom efficiency and creativity, while largely staying away from riskier, audience-facing applications like chatbots. They maintain editorial integrity and report critically on AI companies while simultaneously using their products, like they do with social media. They don’t try to slow the train; they jump aboard and poke around the engine room. They haven’t broken anything and you won’t either. Go play.

  "prediction": "For someone who has built my entire career out of Audience-focused work in great newsrooms, it’s painful to bury my own. But here we are: The standalone Audience team/department/function, as we know it, is dead. If the initial purpose of capital-A “Audience” teams was to transition newsrooms to the future, we always knew we were putting ourselves out of a job. And boy, were we successful! I’ve felt such joy of seeing great audience-first thinkers rise in our industry to become CEOs, founders, executive and managing editors, department heads, chief officers, etc. From Allison Rockey’s  appointment  to executive editor at Vox.com way back in 2017 to Ashley Alvardo  taking the reins  as CEO at Texas Public Radio this December, the momentum has been unstoppable. These leaders’ careers passed through audience-y teams. They lead with the lessons of community listening, platforms, partnerships, metrics, and more to infuse audience DNA in every department and team of their organizations. So everyone in your organization is now your audience team. Reporters think about social heds, newsletter decks and SEO targets as they craft their stories. Editors are strategists and trainers. Designers are responsible for visuals on-platform AND off-platform. The corollary: If your audience team is still siloed away, powerless to impact your colleagues or readers, your organization’s chances of survival in these transformative times is slim. Correct course and  appoint a chief audience officer  to jumpstart the silo-breaking. Where does this transition leave the hundreds of journalists still employed in Audience? The best audiencers are busy running head first into what’s next: creator journalists, or what Pew calls  news influencers . And while the spotlight on these journalists who transcend, or even actively work outside, brand-name media is helpful, it’s not just the change in consumption trends you may have read about in various post-election reflections. It’s also about production: Journalists are more willing to depart their long-time employers to be independent and build their audiences alone (a more lucrative and maybe more sustainable deal for people like Taylor Lorenz, Oliver Darcy, and the like). Publishers are countering by awkwardly trying to triangulate a creator strategy that makes sense for their business and that still foregrounds their brand over the individual. The early signal in the noise for me: I co-created a workshop at the Online News Association conference about how to leave your traditional media role to “go solo” that was oversubscribed by 50%. My workshop co-creator Liz Kelly Nelson has another stat from her  Project C newsletter , where she chronicles the transition to our creator journalism future:  More than 8,000 attendees  joined the recent launch of an online creator course funded by the Knight Foundation. No matter if you’re thinking about newer, independent creator journalists or from inside a legacy media brand, it’s clear how few creators can actually make it alone, despite this idealized picture of the self-reliant Substacker or the lone YouTuber “telling it like it is” in their basement. Nearly all will need help, formally with teams and colleagues that build out their business. Informally, they will also need consultants and “friends of the pod” that enable sustainable growth. This gap is where Audience experts will thrive as the economies and structure of media re-organize themselves. Some will, no doubt, also peel off to be creators themselves. What will this look like? Think about the social media editor who can seamlessly go from ghost writing tweets “on main” to ghost writing for a creator? Think of the newsroom training expert who can design a creator’s online course. The newsletter strategist who can upgrade the calls-to-action for a Substacker to optimize how and when they increase their top-of-funnel audience while also increasing subs. The engagement editor who can manage a Patreon or merch store and ‘cinematic universe’ around a journalist-creator’s brand. Each of these roles can move fully independent themselves as well. These are flexible, worthy careers for talented humans who want to work outside the corporate hierarchy. Adriana Lacy has been growing her  own social media business  for years. Lex Roman has recently launched a consultancy for  optimizing subscriber revenue . The superpower of Audience thinkers is seeing around the corner to what’s coming next (say, digital circa 2008, mobile in 2012, social in 2016, AI in…). If you can ride the wave of technology and catch the winds of attention, your organization (or just you!) can chart the narrow path, escaping what will crush others and stand tall before the next wave comes through.

  "summary": "“2025 will be the year when sports journalists start to really reckon with the fact that teams and players don’t need them anymore.”",
  "prediction": "Could the end of sports journalism as we know it be because of Nick Castellanos? Maybe. A little-discussed story in October involving the Philadelphia Phillies’ outfielder could indicate a massive change to how sports journalism is practiced. It happened leading into the playoffs, when ESPN wanted to do a story about how Castellanos has been  connected to an infamous meme on sports social media . In an interview with MLB Fits on X, Castellanos said: “ESPN actually approached me because they wanted to do an exclusive story on the man who hits home runs at all these inopportune times. But it didn’t work out because they wouldn’t give me editorial rights of the story to make sure that I liked it before it came out. They wouldn’t do that, so opportunity lost.” That idea — that an athlete refused to do a story with the Worldwide Leader in Sports because they wanted to maintain editorial control of the story — is a portent of things to come. 2025 will be the year when sports journalists start to really reckon with the fact that teams and players don’t need them anymore. This has been an issue throughout the digital and social media age, but the vibes around this issue are starting to shift in a noticeable way. This fall, right around the time the Castellanos story happened, the  NFL Players Association announced that it was seeking to move all media interviews out of team locker rooms . What’s notable about Castellanos is that he’s not one of baseball’s biggest stars. He’s an excellent player — a two-time All-Star, a guy who’s hit several big playoff home runs for the Phillies. But he’s not a star on the level of Shohei Ohtani or Aaron Judge. He’s not Derek Jeter  creating his own media outlet . He’s a big-league player who, like so many athletes, has realized he no longer needs sports media the way previous generations did. Sports journalism has historically been the conduit between fans and their favorite players. Newspapers and magazines were the only way fans could hear from their players, so players had an incentive to talk to reporters. But now? Why talk to a gaggle of reporters when you can post to Instagram? Why open yourself up to stories where you have no control over the final product when you can have complete creative and editorial control over your Instagram story, or you can partner with a brand and make a little more money with a sponsored post? The point here is not to discuss the importance of sports journalists having access to players and coaches. The point is that, for teams and players, the necessity isn’t there anymore. I get why sports journalists are freaking out about this. They should be. That access is a core part of their job. But if you look at it from the team and athlete perspective, it makes sense. And from a fan’s standpoint, it does, too. What’s better for a Buffalo Bills fan: Hearing Sean McDermott’s post-game press conference where he answers reporters’ questions? Or seeing his post-game speech to the team on the Bills’ Instagram feed? Ideally, of course, sports media should be a both/and situation, not an either/or. There’s a place for independent sports journalism and there’s a place for team-created content. They can and should live next to each other. This is a time of abundance in all media, especially sports. But if the Nick Castellanoses of the world don’t want to give up editorial control on stories, it might be time for sports journalists to start rethinking their norms and practices. They may not have much of a choice. Brian Moritz  is an associate professor at St. Bonaventure University and author of  Sports Media Guy. "

  "prediction": "In 2025, I predict two things: The mainstream media will lose its last grip on relevancy, and the fundamental gap in understanding between partisan Americans will widen. The gap between mainstream media readers, people who get most of their news through influencers or partisan social media, and people who barely think about news at all will create a fundamental schism in how Americans see the world. The 2024 election showed just how irrelevant mainstream news coverage is outside the beltway and chattering class. A  big chunk of Americans  ignore news completely, or get it sporadically from TikTok, X, or YouTube. Rather than seeking it out, people are exposed to snippets of current affairs as part of curated news feeds, often from obscure or disreputable sources ( only 3% of Facebook’s content is political news ). Meanwhile, the right has capitalized on the decline of legacy media, expertly curating a profitable and thriving ecosystem of podcasters,  influencers,  alt-tech platforms like Rumble, and media companies like the Daily Wire propped up by conservative billionaires and funders. Young talent is found in spaces like TikTok, developed and incubated in spaces like PragerU, promoted by other influencers, and amplified by social media spaces that prioritize conservative content. As  Taylor Lorenz recently pointed out , their leftist equivalents are often stuck working on a shoestring. No matter how liberal they are, left-wing billionaires are unlikely to support creators who advocate for socialism or the abolition of wealth hoarding. Influencers are not bound by journalistic ethics or objectivity and are free to take funding from companies, PACs, and wealthy donors. They speak directly to the concerns of younger people, pushing populist messaging. Entry points into this right-wing ecosystem come through various forms of entrepreneurial hucksterism. Young people faced with high housing costs, dwindling job prospects, and inflation — regardless of what economic statistics say — seize on webinars and YouTube videos by people claiming that you can hustle and grind your way into economic success, whether through crypto, dropshipping, multi-level marketing schemes, or OnlyFans. Once drawn in by promises of glittering wealth, they consume a constant drone of conservative content that promotes regressive gender roles, American isolationism, and toxic individualism. Trump’s messaging works perfectly in this space. As a researcher of far-right disinformation, I spend plenty of time in fringe Telegram communities where people think Joe Biden is a lizard person and QAnon’s allegations are widely accepted as a fact of life. But while claims about kids getting sex changes at school, immigrants eating dogs and cats, and babies murdered under the guise of “abortion” are equally false, a significant portion of the population believes them. As anyone who’s had a friend or loved one go down a similar rabbit hole knows, pointing out that these claims are incorrect doesn’t help. Every absurd assertion has a body of evidence behind it. The most persuasive — like  false claims about immigrants causing crime  — are so  deeply embedded in the American psyche  that they’re very hard to shake. Americans have always lived in different worlds. Think of the Black press, which was founded in the early decades of the nineteenth century to address community needs after white newspapers not only refused to cover issues of concern to Black readers, but routinely spread incorrect, racist, and biased information about Black Americans. Those who read Black newspapers and those who read white newspapers got a different picture of the American experience. As  Dominic-Madori Davis pointed out in her prediction last year , the mainstream press  still  does not cover issues of concern to Black Americans.  75% of U.S. journalists are white , and  most Black Americans believe  that the mainstream media depicts Black people negatively. Amid today’s economic inequality, partisan ecosystems, and the decline of shared cultural touchstones like mainstream media, this compounding disparity has given rise to an ecosystem of Black influencers who — surprise! — spread inaccurate information. Hand-wringing over the 2016 election led to a huge apparatus of disinformation research, and we now understand a lot about why false information spreads (it’s a combination of emotional appeal, partisan animus, and algorithmic amplification). But we are no closer to solving the problem at its center: How can we find common ground when we can’t agree on basic facts? 2024 was the year “disinformation” outlasted its usefulness. Moving forward, we should not be concerned with isolated incorrect facts, but with the deeply-rooted stories that circulate at all levels of culture and shape our points of view. The challenge for 2025 is to confront these deeper epistemic divides that shape how Americans understand the world; in other words, the ways we arrive at the knowledge that forms our perspective. If we don’t start studying these divides with the urgency they demand — and learning from history about how such rifts can be bridged — we’ll be stuck in a permanent cycle of shouting across the void, unable to solve our biggest challenges or even agree on what they are.

  "summary": "“It won’t be long before AI is used to generate new metrics and new analysis, and to push user behavior further away from curated editorial experiences.”",
  "prediction": "For younger colleagues, auto-generated feeds may be all that internet culture has ever offered — especially on apps that order posts based on engagement. But there was a time when social media was mostly all in reverse chronological order. It was…unpleasant, but it was free.  Feed algorithms were introduced to address what sounds like a quantum physics problem: What’s the difference between when an event occurs and its relevance? The approach transformed how the news business worked, and today almost everything online is powered by some version of user experience, data collection, analysis, and recommendations.  For a while, things felt more useful this way — more curated, less awkward. The experiment had worked, we thought, as news stories took the top spots in every social feed. Publishers who posted on social media scrambled to build relationships with platforms that seemingly respected the role of journalism in democracy. Many conferences were held. Did audiences understand how or why particular stories were served specifically to them? Unclear.  During this bucolic era, the role of “editorial judgment” quietly faded.  Curation seemed doomed by the time publishers focused more on what was “most read” than what editors felt was “most relevant,” and even today the two categories haven’t made peace. Most early social media editors, like me, hailed a mixed approach as a celebration of audience relatability and as a new avenue to build trust between newsrooms and the public, which was already eroding by the mid-2000s.  We asked: If audiences knew that newsrooms respected what they read (or watched, or otherwise engaged with) the most, would it create some sense of community? It was a guess and, for a time, it worked so well that billion-dollar startups were born out of boozy media parties. With new metrics created to align “old” and “new” media revenue models, the business of social media engagement optimization boomed. It eventually turned into what we call audience development, growth, and optimization.  Along the way, tens of thousands of journalists with hundreds of thousands of years of combined editorial sense and experience were laid off. That wasn’t part of the deal, was it? Eventually, platforms moved on from prioritizing news, and publishers were largely cast aside for entertainment media.  As it turned out, prioritizing news stories wasn’t always part of the deal with platforms. Many publishers have gone bankrupt since platforms stopped prioritizing news. Since 2016, it’s been unclear what the future of digital publishing would be without paid digital marketing — this was the transition from organic to paid you may hear if you speak to a marketer. 2015 will be a full decade since the tsunami of news audiences first slowed down. Engagement has mostly struggled to find the same reach since feeds became more “useful.”  Many of the jobs that were created to optimize for algorithms were eventually scrapped, too. But something else unexpected happened: Large language models enabled tech companies to imagine media distribution with even fewer people involved. AI will soon replace older feed algorithms and threatens to further weaken the role of editorial judgment in online publishing. It won’t be long before AI is used to generate new metrics and new analysis, and to push user behavior further away from curated editorial experiences. I’m sure of this, because that’s exactly what social algorithms did. (For the record, there are many reasons to be excited about AI, but — as someone who values the creative aspects of media to build audience — I’ll focus on curation alone here.) What stops us from expanding the last innovative module of the homepage, “Most Read/Viewed”? Publishers will soon access AI-created analysis that will “predict” what is most likely to be read. Who will be the first editor to assign stories using not judgment or experience but prediction — based on a database they’ll never fact-check themselves? Doing so will have an impact orders of magnitude more disruptive than anything in the past 20 years. Journalists are tasked to explore the new and unexamined — not gamble with our trade’s ethics by using data we don’t verify.  Future journalists must answer these questions: How does creativity help us discover new stories, or rethink old ones? Can we preserve the artistic qualities of media while also pursuing the best options for the next era of the digital media business? What are the ethics of assigning stories using predictive data?  Meanwhile, continue sending friends links to stories you wrote or produced. Share with colleagues what media you like, and why. Develop taste in writing and formats. Buy that print copy. We may be in the last decades when we do without a chatbot suggesting the right way to curate. Today, I asked Gemini if I should use AI to write stories, and it suggested I consider the limitations of AI before noting it’s a “personal choice.” Every chatbot needs an editor, I say.
