1,Arizona Online-Only Charter School,DE,,USA,"A company named Unbound Academy has received permission to operate an online-only charter school in Arizona, that provides just two hours per day of personalized learning programs in academics from companies like IXL and Khan Academy. No teachers will be involved, as an AI that tracks progress and assignments individually. The intended grades are four to eight. Aditional courses will be held by so called ""guides"" for ""life-skill workshops"". Charter schools are private but funded by government. Many charter schools are operated to remove or add specific topics from the curriculum, mostly for religious reasons.

These so-called constructed response items take way more time than multiple choice questions when scoring the responses, so a new system has been put into action. An AI will score the results first, giving an confidence interval, and humans will re-score if this intervall is low or students complain. If a human rescoring is demanded by students, these will have to pay a fee of 50$, which is canceled only when the scoring improves by this process.",This test is a baseline scoring test for all pupils and is easy accessible., AI automated scoring can improve equality of the scores. ,There is no direct positive impact to the environment.,-,"The test is decisive for the applicant selection process, so any improvement is relevant.",https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/staar https://www.texastribune.org/2024/04/09/staar-artificial-intelligence-computer-grading-texas/

15,AI Application Hub on Plastic Packaging – Sustainable Circular Economy Through Artificail Intelligence,DE,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly reduce plastic waste and extend resource lifecycles, particularly in plastic packaging, which is the largest source of global plastic waste. The AI Application Hub is applying AI techniques throughout the entire value chain, from design to recycling, to overcome the technical and economic challenges that hinder the recycling of plastic into secondary raw materials. Currently, only a small percentage of plastic is successfully reintroduced into the production cycle. To address this issue, the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research has launched the funding measure “AI Application Hub on Plastic Packaging - Sustainable Circular Economy through Artificial Intelligence.” This initiative aims to improve the sustainability of plastic packaging by utilizing AI methods at every stage of the value chain, fostering a more sustainable circular economy.",,,The project has the aim to  reduce the amount of plastic waste.,,,https://ki-hub-kunststoffverpackungen.de/en/ai-hub/about
