1,A didactic in Law between online and artificial intelligence (Una didattica a Giurisprudenza tra online e intelligenza artificiale). University of Turin,IT,,,"Since 2017, this pioneering project not only facilitates the completion of studies, but also uses machine learning algorithms to analyse and predict academic careers, offering a customised and data-driven educational model. This volume recounts the teaching experiments that have characterised the department in recent years. The aim is to think about a didactic offer that is able to take into account all the different categories of students attending the university and to allow a programming oriented to guarantee a differentiated and therefore equal didactic.",,"it is a project to help out-of-school students obtain a degree by offering them online law courses. The intention is also to analyse the data, study its characteristics and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the career progression of students who have not yet graduated. In this way, the department is able to make teaching policy choices related to real data on the performance of students.",,,"From the experience born with the Department of Law, the service has been extended to other study courses: today it analyses the data of more than 200,000 careers, distributed over 62 study courses, involving 22 Departments within the 6 Schools into which the University of Turin is divided.",https://www.collane.unito.it/oa/files/original/a34a6316919bec52add861c46da394fa.pdf
2,EKEEL - Empowering Knowledge Extraction to Empower Learners,IT,,," The aim of EKEEL is to improve the extraction of prerequisite relations from learning videos by proposing a Knowledge Graph model of prerequisite relations aimed at exploiting this quantity of digital resources to produce new value through the transformation and reuse of knowledge. In more detail, the project focuses on extracting knowledge from instructional videos in terms of the concepts explained and the dependency relationships between them, in particular prerequisite relationships, which express the knowledge needed to understand another concept.","The aim of the project is to improve the current state of the art in autonomous understanding of the content of video lectures and to exploit the extracted knowledge to provide advanced learning support services, so that the service provision is sustainable and the knowledge is shareable and reusable. ",,,,"Video lectures have seen exponential growth in recent years for a variety of educational, formal/informal, academic/professional purposes. The scientific contribution in terms of knowledge extraction is an innovative audio-visual approach for the extraction of prerequisite relations that takes into account the analysis of concept dynamics during video streaming, the results of which will also provide new features for the training of deep learning models.",https://www.ilc.cnr.it/progetti/ekeel/
3,Artificial Intelligence for the University of Bordeaux - AI by Ubx,FR,,,"This project aims to establish Bordeaux as a leading center for artificial intelligence (AI) by attracting national and international talents for doctoral programs. The main goal is to double the number of AI PhD holders by 2025 through a three-pronged approach: increasing funding opportunities, attracting new profiles with a high-quality research environment, and strengthening international partnerships. The project is supported by over 40 local researchers and will be implemented by the University's College of Doctoral Schools. It plans to fund 15 doctoral scholarships over five years. The university will also host the Robocup 2020 in Bordeaux to enhance the program's impact and attract more students. ",,,,"Relevant for Goal 17 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. The project is giving impulses to big private global players to develop together innovative products and sustainable solutions, especially in regard to the environment. ","Since the launch of its AI strategy in 2017, 39 key industrial players have joined the University of Bordeaux's drive, covering all the sectors targeted by the national AI plan (Villani Plan). A regional research and innovation network is also being built under the impetus of the Conseil RÃ©gional de Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Inria.

4,Erasmus+ Pathfinder 2024-2026,FI,,"LCHT, HR","By employing strategic guidelines, AI-based tools, and tailored learning programs, educators and students will be equipped with the necessary resources and knowledge to responsibly and effectively integrate AI into the teaching and learning process. The project includes the development of a framework to support teachers, an AI-powered toolkit for lesson planning, and a competency-based learning program for students. These tools aim to enhance employability, foster innovation, and strengthen the resilience of the European education community.",,,,"It underscores the importance of sustainability and responsibility in the implementation of AI technologies. By examining the societal impacts of AI, the project makes a significant contribution to sustainable development and positions the project partners as pioneers in the field of responsible technological innovation in education. ",It aims to provide valuable insights and resources for the entire European education community. ,https://lab.fi/en/news/new-project-promote-ai-competencies-higher-education
