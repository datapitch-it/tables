    "Project_content": {
      "Science cluster": "PANOSC - Photon and Neutron Science",
      "Summary": "The AI-SCOPE project engages the European photon and neutron (PaN) science community to enhance the frequency and quality of FAIR-compliant data submissions to EOSC-indexed databases, such as the ESRF data portal or Zenodo.\nThe project stands to dramatically enhance data FAIRness and beamtime efficiency, by introducing a live AI analysis tool for surface scattering experiments. By rigorously applying it to a diverse array of pre-existing scattering data and enabling live analysis of data from a multitude of sample types we will create a well-curated dataset with detailed annotations in EOSC indexed databases, and lay the groundwork for more uploads with metadata in the future. Both the AI-tool and the curated database will unlock new possibilities for data reuse and collaborative scientific exploration of X-ray and neutron data with machine learning helping also AI-guided materials discovery.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science Service, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThe main challenge of the AI-SCOPE project is to increase the frequency and quality of FAIR-compliant data submissions to EOSC-indexed databases, such as ESRF data portal or Zenodo, by addressing the current lack of well-annotated surface scattering data. Researchers often neglect valuable data due to time constraints, selective attention, and lack of incentives for annotating and sharing datasets. The project seeks to address these issues by introducing an AI tool that enhances real-time data analysis during beamtime and automates the generation of rich metadata, encouraging the reuse and FAIR submission of data in open databases. It must overcome the difficulties of reusing raw data by integrating standardised metadata and facilitating searches for specific materials and structures.",
      "Solution": "The project tri-national team will introduce a sophisticated AI analysis tool for surface scattering experiments that performs an automated initial analysis, and simultaneously generates rich metadata annotations. This dual capability incentivises researchers to utilise the tool, as it streamlines their workflow and gives “live” feedback during experimental sessions at large scale facilities (“beamtimes”).\nThe AI-tool will be designed to use AI to estimate structural sample parameters (such as film thickness, material densities, contact planes and unit cell dimensions) and feed these into the database using standardised metadata formats. This feature ensures the database can be searched for specific materials and structures from the automated AI analysis, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of a hard to re-use raw data dump and increasing reusability within the scientific ecosystem of EOSC / PaNOSC.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The integration of AI-driven analysis tools to EOSC services and the creation of a curated FAIR database represent pivotal advancements in the field of surface scattering. Building on the state-of-the-art, the project will develop individual solutions and make them available, both at large-scale facilities and online, through EOSC services.\nBy automating the analysis processes and enriching datasets with preliminary insights, these innovations enable a more comprehensive exploration of experimental data. This approach not only accelerates the discovery of novel materials but also facilitates meta-studies and machine learning applications in materials discovery. Moreover, providing a curated database as a nucleus and incentivising community contributions through accessible software tools, promises to result in a significantly higher user uptake of EOSC services and open databases, such as Zenodo. Similar to classical machine learning datasets that get used as benchmarks in the respective communities (e.g., ImageNet competition), the project strives to provide such a benchmark dataset to the European community (and beyond) to start also the comparison of different machine learning algorithms on real-world datasets.\nThe project thereby serves as a catalyst for filling Zenodo and EOSC nodes (e.g., ESRF data portal) with valuable, actionable data, thus propelling the surface scattering field toward unprecedented collaborative and scientific achievements.",

    "Project_content": {
      "Science cluster": "ENVRI - Environmental Sciences, LS RI - Life Sciences, PANOSC - Photon and Neutron Science",
      "Summary": "Amber fossils provide a unique window into ancient ecosystems, offering insights into extinct organisms through remarkable preservation of both external and internal structures: fossilised specimens are preserved 3-dimensionally, they allow us to study surface structures of the animals such as hairs, scales or flower structures which are in the rarest case preserved in other forms of fossils, and they occasionally conserve internal soft tissues which allows the complete or partial reconstruction of the inner anatomy of the studied fossil organism.AMBCATaims to centralise and make accessible high-resolution digital scans of these rare fossils, fostering collaboration among researchers and advancing scientific research on a global scale.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThe study of amber fossils is not excluded from difficulties. Conventional imaging tools often fail to capture critical details, especially when inclusions are obscured by other materials, or when the amber is non-transparent, presenting a milky appearance. Additionally, the scattered and redundant imaging efforts across various institutions can lead to wasted resources and missed opportunities for collaboration, hindering comprehensive scientific analysis.",
      "Solution": "AMBCAT aims at making the physical amber fossils data centrally stored and archived at DESY FAIR and open available to the general community and public. A data catalogue will be offered, aggregating and providing all relevant metadata for the digitalised objects together with the imaging protocols. In conjunction with the actual image data, AMBCAT is also expected to provide access to the actual image data, as well as online visualisation tools in a browser-based application. This platform will streamline research effort allowing researchers worldwide to access and use the data, preventing duplication, and enabling comprehensive analysis using advanced μCT scanning technologies, which have shown to be an effective and valuable tool to visualise and create 3D models of amber fossils.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By digitising and cataloguing over 1,500 amber fossils, AMBCAT promotes interdisciplinary research and public engagement, enabling the use of fossil data in fields ranging from climate, ecosystem and biodiversity change, to evolutionary and phylogenetic research. Since amber fossils have fascinated the public ever since, results from amber studies may be used to make concepts of paleoecosystem and climate research accessible to non-scientists. AMBCAT also serves as a bridge between scientific inquiry and public education, offering opportunities for exhibitions, educational resources, and media content that bring paleoscience to life.\nAMBCAT will result in building and strengthening collaboration networks in Europe- and worldwide and lead to synergies, avoiding that a same sample is loaned or scanned/analysed several times by different research groups, and contributing to a usage of scan data for different purposes.",

      "Summary": "TheAMISproject aims to develop an innovative web application specifically designed for humanities researchers, focusing on text analysis for metadata enrichment. It is expected to be a user-friendly tool for assessing metadata quality, enriching it with additional information, and facilitating text analysis. The web application seeks to streamline metadata creation by providing design assistance, improving academic discoverability, and offering personalised recommendations for scholarly data. By leveraging machine learning, AMIS enables a contextualised approach to metadata enrichment, enhancing research processes, particularly for heritage texts in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH).",
      "Challenge": "Open Science Service\nMetadata enrichment in digital humanities is often a manual, time-consuming task, with shared standards being defined but lacking open services that support the large-scale creation of quality metadata. As a result, due to differing interpretations of expectations, information extracted from the same field across a wide range of resources tends to display a high degree of inconsistency. The challenge, therefore, is to strike a balance between speed and precision while taking the researcher’s expertise into account.",
      "Solution": "By developing a context-based web application, AMIS will provide an innovative environment for scholars to create and refine their own metadata in faster and more precise ways while also assisting them in identifying best practices and shared vocabularies for describing text content. The service uses machine learning techniques (text classification, named entity recognition - NER, named entity linking - NEL, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, text summarization, sequence labelling, and dependency parsing) to analyse the uploaded files, compare them with data from international repositories, and suggest enhancements in the form of metadata. The core module of AMIS will be trained on a wide variety of resources hosted in repositories such as Zenodo, Nakala, Rossio, Recolecta, Docta, and several others.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By enhancing metadata quality and coherence, AMIS will contribute to the convergence of conceptual models in text description and analysis within cultural studies and other SSH disciplines. This will increase comparability among similar research conducted in different academic contexts and corpora. The project will also benefit researchers by improving their own metadata. Existing collections will be upgraded, while new digital corpora will be designed from the outset with enriched metadata perspectives. Heritage texts will not only be made available but will also be virtually linked through a multitude of information points to other existing resources, supporting further discoveries about the circulation of ideas and themes across cultural areas and over time. Finally, AMIS promotes better practices for metadata creation, improving the discoverability and reusability of scientific content.",

      "Science cluster": "ENVRI - Environmental Sciences, LS RI - Life Sciences",
      "Summary": "Critical environmental challenges affect aquatic ecosystems worldwide, and the need to coordinate research efforts is increasingly urgent. Mesocosms are key Research Infrastructures (RIs) allowing the study of highly complex environments comparable to natural ecosystems. Mesocosm experiments, which offer controlled yet realistic settings, are crucial for understanding and mitigating the impact of various stressors and their combinations on aquatic ecosystems. The AQUACOSM-RI consortium, comprising over 60 individual state-of-the-art mesocosm facilities at 28 host institutions across Europe, has therefore been instrumental in advancing aquatic environmental research across climate zones including marine, brackish and freshwater ecosystems.\nTheAQUANAVIproject (Navigating Grand Challenges and their Mitigation using Aquatic Experimental RIs) aims to create an interactive atlas of aquatic mesocosm-based experimental research. Data, publications, reports and information generated by the AQUACOSM consortium and other mesocosm facilities worldwide will be integrated into a single, accessible platform incorporating Open Knowledge Maps' AI-driven visual discovery tools. The project will foster collaborations and, by enhancing data FAIRness, it will facilitate fast discovery and efficient use of aquatic RIs globally, accelerating the development of environmental mitigation strategies.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nAquatic ecosystems are under pressure from a variety of stressors, including pollution, habitat degradation, rising temperatures, and ocean acidification. These challenges interact in complex ways, making it difficult to predict their combined effects and develop mitigation measures. Experimental mesocosms, which offer controlled but realistic environments, are critical for studying the impact of these stressors. However, despite their significance, the extensive yet fragmented resources available in mesocosm-based research remain difficult to access and leverage.",
      "Solution": "AQUANAVI addresses this by creating an interactive atlas that integrates data, publications, reports and facility information from theAQUACOSMconsortium and othermesocosm RIs worldwide. This platform enables quick discovery of available resources, facilitating new collaborations and expediting experimental setups. Using theHi Knowledgeplatform, AQUANAVI merges advanced semantic capabilities(e.g.,Wikidata), AI technology (e.g.,Open Knowledge Maps), and visualisation tools (e.g.,Open Knowledge MapsandScholia) to help researchers navigate complex information with ease, using cutting-edge visualisation techniques, artificial intelligence, and knowledge synthesis methods, and bridging gaps between disconnected research facilities and data sources.",
      "Scientific Impact": "Open and collaborative by design, AQUANAVI’s architecture will engage a broad range of research communities. By consolidating data and information from diverse RIs, the platform will leverage and enhance the AQUACOSM and related RIs, securing the reusability and interoperability of existing data collections and better exploration of existing RIs in the future.Compliant with FAIR principles and EOSC requirements, AQUANAVI will ensure the long-term sustainability and openness of its resources, enriching both the ENVRI services portfolio and the broader scientific community. In summary, AQUANAVI will empower researchers and stakeholders to implement measures to mitigate the effects of climate change and other Grand Challenges facing aquatic environments, serving as a key resource within and beyond the European Research Area.",

      "Summary": "Prediction of clinically relevant outcomes is a key asset in chronic non-communicable diseases to guide both patient counselling and targeted therapeutic strategies, and can be a catalyst to demonstrate the impact of Open Science practices when appropriately deployed.TheARTICYSTproject seeks to enhance the prediction of clinically relevant outcomes in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common genetic kidney disease with more than 7 million people affected globally. Prediction of future kidney function loss at a young age is crucial to support patients in major life decisions. By leveraging Open Science practices, the project aims to develop a comprehensive infrastructure for data integration and predictive modelling, supporting patient decision-making and improving therapeutic strategies. The collaboration between two clinical partners and the integration of new data types will drive advancements in understanding and managing this prevalent condition.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project\nADPKD patients face uncertainty regarding their future kidney function, impacting critical life decisions and treatment plans. Current prediction tools lack precision and do not allow for integration of different data types. This knowledge is crucial to guide therapeutic decision-making processes considering that the only available targeted therapy – the vasopressin-V2-receptor antagonist tolvaptan – comes with considerable side effects and needs to be taken life-long.Furthermore, including data across centres, which would be pivotal to improve such tools and allow for comparability of disease-courses, is non-trivial, hindering the ability to create reliable predictive models.",
      "Solution": "ARTICYST will build an infrastructure to solve this problem based on existing multicentre data from large ADPKD cohorts and by making use of operational and existing services of the Science Clusters for the Life Sciences. The project will integrate all available clinical and laboratory data with genotype and MRI imaging results by optimised unbiased model building. Beyond using data contained in existing dedicated research databases, the ARTICYST framework will exploit the full power of all data contained in clinical information systems. Besides, an entirely new layer of predictive power is added by serum proteome data which has already been obtained from all cohorts using a dedicated mass spectrometry pipeline. This will be enabled through innovative database design to integrate omics and clinical data enhanced through the interaction with ELIXIR.In a second step, turning the proteome containing models into clinical diagnostics will require the establishment of targeted diagnostic assay panels. While this cannot be performed within the project at-hand, this process will be initiated in interaction with EATRIS.To prepare the extension of the ARTICYST platform towards additional centres and their biosamples in the future, ARTICYST will reach out to BBMRI-ERIC.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The impact of ARTICYST extends beyond ADPKD. The developed platform has the potential to address similar challenges in other chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). By establishing targeted diagnostic assay panels and collaborating with patient advocacy groups, the project will increase the visibility of Open Science practices in clinical research. ARTICYST aims to create a sustainable infrastructure that can be adapted for future research and treatment advancements across various medical fields, promoting improved health outcomes for patients globally.",

      "Summary": "(Standardised) content identification is becoming an essential requirement for bioimaging data reuse and the seamless integration of bioimaging data into AI models. Transparency regarding the origin of data, distinguishing between conventionally generated and AI-generated data, is essential to maintain data integrity and facilitate informed analysis. In this context, the International Standard Content Code - ISCC is a new, open-source identification system and globalISO standard, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and widespread adoption. TheBIO-CODES projectseeks to enhance the AI-readiness of bioimaging data by developing and implementing content-based identifiers, using ISCC. The project addresses the increasing complexity of bioimaging data, ensuring it adheres to FAIR principles, and prepares datasets for reliable use in AI-driven analyses.

      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Industry cooperation, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nAs bioimaging data grows in complexity, much of it remains non-compliant with FAIR principles, which complicates data reuse and AI integration. Current methods for identification and certification of bioimaging data lack the robustness needed for generative AI models, risking data integrity, data reliability, thus scientific reproducibility. Addressing these gaps is essential to ensure bioimaging data’s value in Life Sciences research and mitigating biases in AI-driven analyses.",
      "Solution": "BIO-CODES will evaluate the ISO 24138 International Standard Content Code (ISCC) and apply it to bioimaging data in Life Science research. Generated from digital content using cryptographic and similarity hash algorithms, ISCC ensures data integrity and supports use cases like deduplication, database synchronisation, and data provenance. The project will test routine proprietary formats from imaging core facilities and engage vendors. If ISCC proves useful, recommendations will be made for integrating it into existing workflows and software applications used for authentication and certification of bioimages. The main goal is to assess ISCC's applicability and create a proof-of-concept, with integration into platforms like OMERO to ensure FAIR compliance.\n*OMERO is one of the most versatile and widely used platforms for managing bioimaging data, offering tools for storage, organisation, and analysis. By seamlessly integrating globally unique identifiers into OMERO it will streamline AI-driven bioimaging data preparation while ensuring data integrity and FAIR compliance. Standardised authentication processes will enable researchers to share datasets confidently, enhancing transparency and reproducibility. This approach also addresses ethical concerns in AI, mitigating biases from unverified data and promoting reliable AI models in biomedical research.",
      "Scientific Impact": "BIO-CODES will enhance transparency and collaboration among researchers by introducing standardised content identifiers in bioimaging workflows.

      "Summary": "Over the last 25 years, the European Union has been solidly committed to making its cities and local communities more sustainable. Indeed, European communities, cities and regions have engaged in Local Sustainability Transition (LST), making the EU a laboratory for sustainable solutions, including the socio-technical aspects of transition. In this context, the CASTAL project consolidates over 500 European case studies on LST into a centralised digital repository: theCase Studies Atlas of Local Sustainability Transition - CASTAL, a new digital research object collecting FAIR-compliant case studies (mainly licensed in CC by). CASTAL contributes to Open Science and EOSC, by enabling future research and the exploitation of research results by researchers from SSH and other disciplines, and from local authorities, businesses and citizens.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThe CASTAL project addresses several key challenges in leveraging existing research on LST in Europe. These include the fragmentation of knowledge, as case studies are dispersed across multiple repositories and projects; the lack of centralised archives for storing and preserving data; and insufficient efforts to organise data using indexes or metadata. Additionally, difficulties in aggregating data from multiple studies on the same cases hinder comprehensive analysis. As a result, valuable insights from two decades of LST research remain underutilised for future research and practical applications, such as cross-case comparisons or diachronic studies.",
      "Solution": "The CASTAL project proposes several solutions for leveraging research on LST in Europe. It will create an archive collecting over 500 case studies, ensuring preservation and accessibility; a metadata dataset, describing each and all of the case studies (data are curated and deposited in DASSI repositories); and a web portal as a companion tool for increasing the accessibility and findability of the Atlas, and allowing users to update the Atlas as new case studies are produced.\nThe project aims to engage with the scientific community of reference and with other actors (e.g., local authorities, European stakeholders), promote ten secondary studies using CASTAL as a data source, and develop web services and guidelines for updating the Atlas.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By adhering to FAIR data principles, CASTAL will improve data sharing and reuse among researchers, local authorities, and businesses, maximising the impact of LST research and fostering evidence-based sustainability solutions in local communities and municipalities across Europe. The project will also integrate with CESSDA ERIC for long-term curation, creating a multi-purpose platform that supports cross-case analysis and knowledge brokerage for various stakeholders: SSH researchers, local authorities, policymakers and stakeholders with information and knowledge about the state of LST around Europe.",

Researchers in energy, chemistry, and environmental sciences, among others, will benefit from easier access to XAS data. By implementing CDIF for XAS data (XAS-CDIF), the project tackles the interoperability and reusability challenges described above, and can better integrate the XAS data into the emerging EOSC infrastructures for cataloguing, integration and analysis. The benefits will be considerable: existing resources will become more available, and it will become easier and more efficient to use data across RIs and in other domains.

      "Summary": "Research Software (RS) has become a key asset to support, reuse and reproduce research outputs described in scientific publications. The growing acknowledgment of RS’s importance is reflected in initiatives, such as the Software Citation Principles, which advocate for the recognition of software contributions in academic curricula. However, the current state of Research Software metadata remains fragmented and inconsistent, hindering effective usage and compliance with FAIR principles. TheCODEMETASOFTproject aims to develop a comprehensive framework to streamline the management, enrichment, and propagation of RS metadata, thereby enhancing interoperability and supporting the scientific community's efforts to leverage software in research effectively.",
      "Challenge": "RS metadata is crucial for assessing RS FAIRness, and its significance in academia is increasingly recognised, but navigating the existing metadata landscape presents multiple challenges: 1) software metadata is currently disseminated in heterogeneous files and documentation, and there is currently no framework integrating them. As a result, developers usually have to manually duplicate efforts when creating metadata records. 2) Software metadata consistency and curation are performed by hand. 3) There is a lack of automated tools to suggest enhancements and fill gaps in RS metadata.",
      "Solution": "CODEMETASOFT will develop an innovative framework based on the CodeMeta standard. This framework will feature an Autocomplete CodeMeta Wizard adopting CodeMeta as a common metadata interchange format, to simplify the creation of metadata records and automate the management, enrichment and propagation of RS metadata across RS project files. The project will also introduce methodologies to compare similar (or complementary) metadata records, while detecting RS metadata gaps and enrichment suggestions to improve the quality and completeness of metadata records and README files.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The implementation of CODEMETASOFT is poised to enhance the quality and consistency of Research Software metadata across Europe, promoting better compliance with FAIR principles. By reducing the manual workload and providing automated solutions for metadata management, the project aims to foster a more interoperable and reliable ecosystem for research outputs. While the resources developed will be made publicly available under an Open Source licence, the developed tools will be integrated with both the ESCAPE Open Source Software and Service Repository - OSSR (which uses CodeMeta as a source of metadata) and the EOSC. With the increasing adoption of CodeMeta by European research infrastructures, the project has the potential to make a critical impact by improving the quality of metadata at its core without disrupting the workflows followed by RSEs.",

      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nUnderstanding how galaxies formed after the Big Bang and evolved over time is a fundamental question in astronomy. This type of investigation requires deep radio images with sub-arcsecond resolution, which the pan-European LOFAR radio telescope can provide. However, the lack of automated pipelines for processing the vast data volume has hindered the utilisation of all available LOFAR stations, resulting in images with significantly lower resolution and sensitivity.",
      "Solution": "COPLI will develop an interoperable and sustainable processing pipeline for widefield high-resolution LOFAR imaging. The aim is to create a pipeline capable of running in a (largely) automated fashion on large-scale computing infrastructures while ensuring that the pipeline and science products adhere to FAIR principles. This includes improving data lineage by enhancing the data processing framework, software, and derived science products with provenance information, resulting in higher traceability and reproducibility. All science-ready data products will be ingested into a FAIR and trusted repository that is federated with EOSC to make them visible and accessible to the global astronomical community.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The COPLI project will deliver an ultra-deep radio view of our Universe, with images and catalogue products accompanied by comprehensive processing history and metadata, made available to the global astronomical community, other research domains, and citizen scientists. The availability of the images to the entire community will facilitate numerous other radio and multi-wavelength astronomical studies, such as the evolution of black hole accretion and time-variable radio emission from stars and exoplanets. COPLI will serve as an inspiring example of how Open Science can contribute to advancing research and knowledge in the field of astronomy. In this respect, the project's state-of-the-art pipeline will be crucially important for the LOFAR ERIC LOFAR2.0 project and the LOFAR community.

This groundbreaking event marked the beginning of a new era in astronomy, driving the establishment of Open Science frameworks, such as the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC). As Europe prepares for the next-generation Einstein Telescope (ET), the ETAP project will provide researchers and citizen scientists with an innovative platform and advanced tools to access and analyse the complex data expected from future GW detections, fostering collaborative multi-messenger research and promoting sustainability in scientific computing.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Citizen science, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThe ET will increase the detection rate of GWs by a factor of a thousand compared to current detectors, producing data of unprecedented complexity. This surge in data complexity, combined with the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration in multi-messenger astronomy, presents a significant computational and data integration challenge. Furthermore, ensuring that these complex datasets fully adhere to FAIR principles will require the development of new platforms capable of managing resources from multiple Research Infrastructures (RIs) while addressing sustainability concerns in high-performance computing.",

A key focus is on extending the ESCAPE VRE to work with multiple Data Lakes, enabling seamless access to data and metadata from multiple RIs to support multi-messenger and GW science. In this context, a high-level tool written in python will be developed to provide a more coherent interaction with multiple Data Lakes, together with a common interface to ensure FAIR-compliant metadata integration. Finally, the ETAP project will also design a monitoring service to record computing metrics of the ETAP, allowing analysis of GW science pipelines computing costs.",

These databases store plant occurrence and abundance records sampled across the continent for over a century. Such plots are the primary source of information on plant diversity in natural and anthropogenic habitats and their changes over time. EVA, the European Vegetation Archive currently contains more than 2 million vegetation plots with approx. 50 million plant occurrence records.\nThe goal of the project is to move EVA data towards open access, publishing them in trusted and FAIR-compliant repositories, such as Zenodo.\nBy advancing open science practices, the project supports researchers, conservationists, and citizen scientists across Europe, enabling comprehensive analyses of biodiversity changes over time.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project\nThe European Vegetation Archive (EVA) has historically faced data ownership restrictions that hindered full data openness. While the archive has contributions from 108 data providers and contains extensive records essential for biodiversity research, its varying access levels - Open Access, Semi-restricted Access, and Restricted Access - have limited the potential utility of this wealth of information. As more data providers recognise the advantages of adopting FAIR principles, there is a pressing need to facilitate a transition toward more open access, which can greatly enhance collaboration and data sharing across the continent.",
      "Solution": "The EVA-FAIR project will implement a two-phase approach to facilitate this transition. Firstly, it plans to use and develop the Czech National Phytosociological Database (CNPD) as a model for best practices in data sharing. This pilot will produce open datasets and develop R codes for taxonomic harmonisation and data export to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which is a global open-access online database of data on plant occurrences used for numerous projects of basic and applied research and for citizen science. An open version of the database (CNPD-Open), and a taxonomically harmonised and geographically and environmentally stratified subset of this database (CNPD-Open-Strat) will be released. All the data and scripts will be published on Zenodo, GitHub linked with Zenodo, and the EOSC-compliant Czech National Repository Platform.\nThe second phase will engage EVA data providers through workshops and training sessions, showcasing the benefits of open data, and equipping them with the necessary skills to contribute to the initiative.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By advancing the public availability of European vegetation-plot data, EVA-FAIR will significantly enhance the resources accessible to researchers and conservation practitioners alike. This project aims to break down barriers that have restricted access to valuable biodiversity data. It will also foster interdisciplinary research and applied studies in nature conservation and ecosystem restoration. The project not only aligns with the goals of the Environmental Research Infrastructures (ENVRI) Community and the International Association for Vegetation Science but also aims to improve citizen science initiatives in regions where high-quality biodiversity data remain scarce, ultimately enriching our understanding of Europe's plant diversity.",

      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nUnderstanding the evolution of coding genes and their functions is crucial in evolutionary biology, yet many protein-coding genes remain poorly characterised, particularly in non-model organisms. This lack of functional annotation, especially in what is termed the 'dark proteome' - genes  within a proteome without functional annotation - leads to incomplete models of evolutionary change and limits the identification of conserved or lineage-specific features. Traditional homology-based methods often fail to adequately transfer functional annotations. With the advent of initiatives such as the European Reference Genome Atlas or ATLASEA, where new genomes from non-model organisms are being sequenced and released daily, we need to leverage faster and scalable sequence-based functional prediction methods. In this line, embracing concepts from orthogonal disciplines, such as computer science and Artificial Intelligence (AI), could alleviate the problem.",

      "Summary": "Disordered biomolecules, such as lipids and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), are crucial to understanding cellular membranes and protein behaviours, yet standardised and accessible training data for these molecules is lacking. TheFAIRMD projectbuilds on the success of the NMRlipids Databank, which provides open access to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lipid bilayers. By expanding the database to include MD simulations of disordered proteins, and by improving its interoperability with existing public databases, FAIRMD aims to fill this gap, offering high-quality, FAIR data to support AI model development. This will enhance research across biophysics, drug design, and materials sciences.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Main RI concerned\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research is significantly hampered by the lack of standardised, accessible training data. While databases like the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have revolutionised biological research, similar resources for disordered biomolecules, such as lipids and IDPs, are lacking. This creates a barrier for AI-driven research and limits advancements in areas, such as drug development and biomaterial design.",
      "Solution": "FAIRMD aims to expand the NMRlipids Databank, a collaborative resource for MD simulations of lipid bilayers, to include disordered proteins, providing researchers with programmatic access to quality evaluated MD simulation models of disordered proteins. This advancement will enable the development of AI models to predict structural and dynamical properties of disordered biomolecular complexes from atomistic details. Bridging quality-evaluated MD simulations to other databases containing biological functions and biophysical properties of molecules will benefit a wide range of fields with high societal impact, such as design of sustainable materials, novel foods, and drugs.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By addressing practical challenges in data distribution with open collaboration and overlay-databank approaches, the project promotes FAIR data sharing and supports the development of AI-based tools. The application of the open collaboration model, with shared authorship in the resulting publications, and the overlay-data bank concept promoted by FAIRMD are not limited to biophysical chemistry but bear potential advances across scientific domains.",

      "Summary": "TheFAIRYproject focuses on enhancing YEASTRACT+, a widely used open-access FAIRsharing Knowledge-base and repository developed by ELIXIR, that supports research on yeast transcriptional regulation. Yeasts are vital organisms in both the bioeconomy, e.g. through the industrial production of food, energy and commodities, and in health research, due to their role as pathogens and model organisms for studying genetics and disease. FAIRY aims to significantly advance scientific understanding of yeast regulatory networks and improve the platform by integrating advanced data analysis tools, ensuring compliance with FAIR principles. By relying on the Galaxy Europe platform for raw data curation, the project will link with the EOSC, increasing the database’s scientific utility and promoting data sharing across disciplines.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nDespite YEASTRACT+'s role as a leading resource for yeast transcriptional regulation, it currently lacks quantitative gene expression data. Moreover, many yeast species in the database remain poorly characterised, impeding the understanding of their regulatory mechanisms and broader bioeconomic applications. Additionally, many yeast species remain understudied, hindering our understanding of their regulatory mechanisms. The FAIRY project aims to tackle this challenge by incorporating machine learning models trained on cross-species regulatory data, while ensuring that the data remains FAIR.",
      "Solution": "FAIRY will develop and integrate tools for quantitative transcriptomics analysis within YEASTRACT+, allowing researchers to identify regulatory interactions and assess their quantitative impact on gene expression levels. The project will rely on the Galaxy Europe platform for raw data curation, in particular large-scale RNA-seq data processing, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of quantitative transcriptomics analysis. Additionally, machine learning models trained on cross-species regulatory data will be employed to predict new transcriptional regulatory rules for transcription factor activity and evolution in poorly-characterised yeasts. To align with the FAIR principles, the project will develop web services, or APIs, enabling seamless data exchange between YEASTRACT+ and major biological databases (such as GenBank, KEGG, MetaCyc, SGD/CGD, and FungiDB), thus enhancing data accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. Researchers will be able to effortlessly access and combine YEASTRACT+ data with information from these complementary resources, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of yeast regulatory networks.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By combining data on how genes are regulated and how yeast cells process nutrients, the FAIRY project will improve our understanding of how transcription factors control gene expression and the consequent phenotypic outcome. It will also allow scientists to predict how these regulatory events affect the cell’s metabolism, which is important for optimising yeast-based production processes towards a circular bioeconomy. The project will help researchers identify which genes are essential for the cell's survival, not just in metabolism but also in how genes are regulated. This will expand current tools used for identifying potential drug targets. Typically, each user has to perform these calculations themselves. The FAIRY project will pre-calculate these outcomes for a range of yeast species (currently limited to S. cerevisiae and C. albicans), storing them in a central database. By offering ready-made predictions, the project will make it easier for scientists to reuse the data, speeding up research in designing better yeast strains for industry and finding new antifungal drug targets.",

      "Summary": "Understanding the properties of stars, such as their temperature and brightness, is crucial for studying stellar evolution, but it requires analysing and comparing data from measurements of brightness at all wavelengths, as well as measuring the distance to the star, correcting all such measurements, and finally comparing data to the best models of stars. TheGASPSproject aims to do this for the entire sky. Leveraging the PySSED tool -  the Python Stellar Spectral Energy Distribution package - GASPS integrates and analyses data from multiple catalogues - including that of the European Space Agency’s Gaia satellite, with datasets of over a billion stars - ensuring the data is FAIR. The final aim is to make the data easily accessible to researchers, educators, and the general public, and the software freely available and compatible with other astronomy software for further data reuse.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Industry cooperation\nThe measurement of fundamental stellar parameters, such as temperature, brightness, and interaction with the environment is vital for understanding stellar life cycles. However, integrating and cross-referencing star data across vast catalogues, such as Gaia, which includes over a billion stars, poses a significant challenge, leading to a lack of availability and FAIRness in these key data. Complex corrections are required to account for distance, dust, and gas interference, demanding advanced tools to streamline these analyses across such massive datasets.",
      "Solution": "GASPS aims to use the PySSED package to automatically combine and analyse stellar data from multiple sources. PySSED automatically brings together measurements of stars from different catalogues and estimates the star's temperature and inherent brightness, accounting for both the distance to the star and how its light is affected by dust and gas between the star and the Earth. The project will make PySSED compliant with the open-data standards of the Virtual Observatory (VO), publishing the updated version available on the EXPLORE platform, with open access to both software and data, and will apply these advanced calculations to the entire Gaia DR3 all-sky survey of 1,467,744,818 stars, offering public access to stellar parameters, such as temperature and UV/IR excess. Additionally, it will provide visualisation tools to explore and use this immense dataset.",

It will make existing catalogues Findable and Accessible in a transparent way, and will support use cases across ESCAPE’s RIs and other facilities.\nGASPS will boost the impact of PySSED by aligning it with VO standards to improve interoperability. This will allow easier integration into VO workflows, including linking PySSED with other VO tools within the EOSC umbrella (e.g., TopCat). The advanced tools and data products foreseen in the frame of GASPS will significantly extend the Gaia DR3 catalogue with self-consistent, reliable data on physical parameters of stars, cross-referencing data from several ESFRI facilities, including ESO and other ESA satellite missions, and ongoing/future large-scale surveys, such as those of Euclid and the Vera Rubin Observatory.

      "Summary": "The HiMAGNETOS project aims to advance the development of standards and tools to reduce the obstacles for researchers to make their experimental data FAIR. It will do so by enhancing open access to high magnetic field research data generated at the Laboratoire National des Champs Magnétiques Intenses (LNCMI) within the EOSC framework. The project strives to establish comprehensive standards, develop specialised tools, and create a centralised data repository that will facilitate the production of FAIR data. By streamlining these processes, the project aims to reduce barriers for researchers, ensuring that experimental data can be easily shared, accessed, and reused, thus promoting a more collaborative research environment.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nHigh magnetic field research plays a vital role in advancing various scientific disciplines, yet access to related data is often restricted. While some open data initiatives, such as the NHMFL MagLab in the USA, exist, they primarily promote generic frameworks that do not adequately address the specific requirements of high magnetic field experiments. This lack of targeted support creates significant barriers for researchers who wish to share their findings or access critical experimental data. Consequently, the potential for collaboration and innovation in this field is stifled, highlighting the urgent need for a structured approach to improve data accessibility.",
      "Solution": "HiMAGNETOS will implement a common data management plan derived from insights gained in the ISABEL H2020 project, which focuses on improving the sustainability of the EMFL. The project will adapt existing frameworks, such as the DataCite Metadata Schema and Nexus Format, to meet the unique challenges posed by high magnetic field conditions. A central data repository will be established for both in-house and external users, complete with defined curation policies and uploading procedures. Additionally, the project will link research data to the original experimental proposals, enhancing data quality and usability by providing context, such as magnetic field homogeneity and other facility-related parameters. This comprehensive approach aims to create a robust data ecosystem that supports diverse research needs.\nMoreover, the LNCMI has developed, over the years, many data reduction software for each kind of high field experimental techniques. These software packages allow reading the raw data from the acquisition systems, adjust reduction parameters and save the reduced data and some metadata in a user-friendly format. To ensure data reuse and interoperability, these software packages will be made open source or available as an online notebook.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The advancements made through the HiMAGNETOS project will significantly enhance collaboration and reproducibility in high magnetic field research. By making data and tools openly available, the project will not only improve the accessibility of high-quality experimental data but also set a precedent for future initiatives within the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL) community. HiMAGNETOS is envisioned as a pilot phase toward the broader integration of EMFL services into the EOSC, fostering a culture of Open Science in the field. Ultimately, HiMAGNETOS will empower researchers to build upon existing data, leading to innovative discoveries and a deeper understanding of high magnetic field phenomena.",

      "Summary": "In today's interconnected world, communities face a diverse range of hazards, including natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and landslides, as well as human-induced events. To address these challenges, theHOMEROSproject aims to strengthen multi-hazard assessment methodologies in seismology, geodesy, and geology. Leveraging technical solutions suited to the big data era, HOMEROS represents a significant advancement in standardising research processes, promoting collaboration, and enhancing understanding and prediction capabilities for natural hazards through Open Science practices. Focusing on high-risk areas in Greece with significant seismic activity, strong earthquakes, floods, and landslides, HOMEROS will compile earthquake catalogues and assess ground deformation products to provide a comprehensive evaluation of seismic hazards. Additionally, it will enhance the understanding of flood and landslide risks, vital for effective mitigation strategies.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nCommunities worldwide face a wide range of natural and human-induced hazards, which require more robust, data-driven approaches to assessment and mitigation. In regions like Greece, where seismic activity, floods, and landslides pose significant threats, existing observation systems often lack standardisation when combining interoperable services from diverse resources related to essential geohazard variables, hindering effective multi-hazard assessments. The HOMEROS project addresses these issues by developing methodologies that harmonise data and services, aiming for a more unified and comprehensive hazard assessment strategy.",
      "Solution": "The project integrates interoperable services from various sources, including pan-European data services (within the ENVRI Science Cluster), local resources (at the national level), and the EOSC, to standardise research processes. By comparing two geographical areas in Greece as case studies, each representing multi-hazard environments, HOMEROS aims to identify network and data needs crucial for improving earth observation and hazard assessment capabilities. Integration with the ENVRI Community and the EOSC will enable HOMEROS to utilise Open Science environments effectively, facilitating multidisciplinary data exchangeability and showcasing the value of integrating e-science tools in research. Moreover, the project will address data challenges, develop scientific workflows, and provide open access datasets and products essential for comprehensive multi-hazard assessments, including seismic data, ground deformation data, and information on landslides and floods.",
      "Scientific Impact": "HOMEROS will establish links between institutions, research infrastructures (RIs) and projects to disseminate results and promote the use of RI services for scientific purposes. Through the promotion of Open Science practices, it aims to democratise access to knowledge, encourage multi-disciplinary collaboration, and enhance community resilience against interconnected hazards. By offering accessible ecosystems for data exchange following the FAIR principles, HOMEROS will advance scientific knowledge in multi-hazard assessment. Its approach, characterised by transparent data sharing, collaborative modelling, and active community engagement, aims to catalyse significant changes in disaster preparedness, response strategies, and recovery processes.

Leveraging Diamond’s XChem service and the Fragalysis Cloud platform, the project will streamline data deposition and establish a first-of-its-kind tool for sharing, exploring, and evolving SBDD experiments. This will significantly lower the barrier to open data sharing, advancing drug discovery methodologies.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThere is a strong consensus in the field of medicinal chemistry, that existing datasets for exploring and improving structure-based drug design (SBDD) are highly inadequate. The state-of-the-art of data availability has evolved into the separate repositories of the Protein Data Bank (accessed through PDBe in ELIXIR), and the ChEMBL database. These are individually well-developed and highly FAIR, but only for very specialised informaticians, and with necessarily strictly constrained ontologies. Moreover, data is often fragmented across various tools and hidden in unstructured formats, making it difficult for researchers to access and build upon existing datasets",
      "Solution": "The project aims to enhance the Fragalysis Cloud platform to facilitate open and FAIR-compliant sharing of SBDD data. Fragalysis Cloud is a collaboration platform developed at Diamond’s XChem facility, used for curating, sharing and disseminating views of 3D data, and implementing best-practice medicinal chemistry algorithms and workflows for progressing results from fragment screens through early DMTA cycles. The project will map out clearly how Fragalysis can be a platform for collectively annotating and depositing data to PDBe and ChEMBL. Furthermore, it will make details of annotation workflows and computations accessible from those repositories, and generalised workflows will be made available to WorkflowHub.\nBy integrating data from 50–150 experiments, the project will create an accessible mechanism for depositing and querying large-scale datasets. Collaborating with key INSTRUCT (XChem) and ELIXIR services (PDBe and ChEMBL), which host the key data categories of the field (3D structures of protein-compound complexes and assay results of the compounds, including biochemical activity, biophysical affinity and ADME measurements), the project will enable researchers to explore SBDD projects with comprehensive data on context, provenance, design rationales and inspection of computational analyses.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The project will revolutionise the accessibility and reuse of SBDD data, providing an innovative tool for examining collective datasets in a FAIR manner. By making previously isolated data (and metadata) available for querying across projects, the project will improve transparency and reproducibility of experiments, while allowing  to advance methodology and algorithms in the field. Researchers and developers will benefit from the insights gained from shared workflows, while contributing significantly to the FAIR data landscape in the life sciences.\nThe scientific relevance of the tools will be stress-tested by applying the new tools to real-world XChem data, both historic and new, and training the user community in their use, thereby greatly expanding the quantity and quality of SBDD data in the public domain.",

      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Main RI concerned\nIn the realms of computational chemistry and materials science, there is a pressing need to address the fragmented landscape of research data. Current practices in research data management often lead to inefficiencies in data sharing, limiting researchers’ ability to access and utilise valuable datasets. Moreover, the lack of adherence to FAIR data principles hinders the reproducibility of scientific findings and inhibits collaborative efforts. All this makes the need for a more integrated and adaptable data management solution increasingly evident.",
      "Solution": "The ioChem-BD project provides a comprehensive approach to overcoming these challenges by developing a robust platform that promotes FAIR data practices. Key objectives include assessing researchers’ real needs for FAIR data, developing software tools fostering user proficiency and data quality control features, and creating software tools to contribute to the adoption of FAIR data principles in the computational chemistry and materials science community. By integrating Semantics Data Models (SDM) into the repository, ioChem-BD ensures that data from various origins can be analysed collectively, enhancing the potential for insightful research outcomes. Additionally, the project will host workshops, talks and meetings with the community, to further improve data FAIRness and the platforms.",

      "Summary": "FAIR data management and the ability to track (meta)data from sample collection to the final computed (or derived) datasets have become increasingly crucial due to the increasing size and diversity of data generated across various scientific disciplines. However, to ensure reproducibility, comprehensive provenance metadata also needs to be available. Lab Integrated Data (LabID) is a web-based integrated platform designed to help individual scientists, research groups and core facilities to better manage, annotate and share their experiments, assays, samples and datasets actively, in compliance with FAIR principles. While in LabID processed data can already be stored and connected to its primary data, associated assays and original samples, accurate modelling of both workflow (WF) and WF runs is currently lacking. TheLabID-PROV projectaims to extend the LabID data model to include these concepts, offering a unified application to manage derived data provenance independently from analysis procedure and platform, and providing a concrete solution to ensure the traceability of derived data.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science Service, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nManaging the increasing volume and variety of (meta)data - from sample collection to derived datasets - poses significant challenges in scientific research. While primary data is regularly shared in repositories, the sharing of final derived datasets remains inadequate. This is often due to the lack of comprehensive provenance metadata that ensures reproducibility and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the diverse languages, tools, and computing environments used by various stakeholders complicate the tracking of workflows and their corresponding metadata, limiting the reusability of shared data and hindering Open Science efforts.",
      "Solution": "LabID-PROV proposes to enhance the LabID platform by allowing accurate modelling of both WFs and WF runs. To this end, the project will use several resources in the LS RI Science Cluster, namely, WorkflowHub, a resource for WF indexing, discovery and re-use; RO-Crate, which can be used to package and share research objects including WF and WF runs using the WF and WF Run RO-Crate profiles; Galaxy, a web-based analysis platform; and Zenodo, an open platform for preserving and sharing research output. The main goal is to streamline the import of datasets (and their metadata) described using Workflow Run RO-Crate profiles into LabID. Also, the project will implement use cases using both omics and imaging data, reflecting real-world scenarios, to demonstrate the integration of the new LabID capabilities into the existing Open Science landscape. These use cases will be used to generate online LabID tutorials demonstrating best practices in WF development and the FAIR dissemination of associated derived data with their provenance. Finally, wider dissemination of this work will be achieved by registering the training in the Training eSupport System and through a future LabIDPROV workshop.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The LabID-PROV project aims to bridge critical gaps in data traceability to facilitate FAIR sharing of derived data together with their provenance metadata, through the integration of LS RI Science Cluster tools and standards. LabID-PROV not only will enhance the reproducibility of scientific findings but also encourages researchers across various disciplines to adopt robust data management practices. The project will ultimately support a wider community of scientists, enabling them to efficiently share valuable research outputs and contribute to a more sustainable Open Science ecosystem.",

      "Summary": "The MADDEN project is designed to tackle a key challenge in modern scientific research: facilitating seamless data access and sharing across multiple Research Infrastructures (RIs) in international collaborations. Scientific experiments, especially in fields such as gravitational wave (GW) research, often produce vast amounts of data stored in isolated Data Lakes. This fragmentation creates barriers to collaboration and data access. TheMADDENproject aims to build a multi-RI Data Lake managed with Rucio, a robust open-source framework for data management, distribution and access, initially developed to meet the requirements of the ATLAS experiment in High Energy Physics (HEP), and now widely adopted across various scientific communities. The project enhances Rucio to create a unified Multi-RI Data Lake, supporting international efforts to share and analyse experimental data more effectively, all within the EOSC framework.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Citizen science, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nModern scientific research, especially in fields such as GW research, requires international collaboration. Each RI typically manages its own data in isolated Data Lakes, hindering easy access and shared analysis. The emerging need is to establish a common data infrastructure that allows scientists to securely access data across multiple RIs for more efficient collaboration and discovery, especially as projects such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) prepare for the future of GW research.",
      "Solution": "The MADDEN project aims to build a multi-RI Data Lake managed with Rucio. It will deploy the relevant services for the ET Data Lake based on Rucio, and build a multi-RI Data Lake by deploying a mock-up of a CE Data Lake, managed by an independent Rucio instance. Rucio authentication features will be extended to allow ET users to seamlessly access data from both ET and CE Rucio instances.The project will also advance and test RucioFS, a tool originally developed by INFN-Torino to provide a POSIX-like view of the Rucio catalogue in a multi-RI environment, implementing the required missing functionalities to be used in a production environment.Additionally, it is proposed to leverage Rucio metadata capabilities to incorporate the possibility of making rich metadata queries in RucioFS for filtering search results according to metadata conditions.Finally, the project aims to set up a demonstrator for the Virgo collaboration to test the technology.",
      "Scientific Impact": "All developments proposed in this project (a multi-RI capable Rucio, a production-ready RucioFS and scalable metadata queries in Rucio) are part of the ESCAPE distributed data management (DDM) roadmap, and are applicable also in contexts beyond the GW community.As Rucio is the DDM solution adopted by the ESCAPE Science Cluster within EOSC, this project is the first necessary architectural step towards a consistent support of Open Science and the FAIR data principles in the GW physics domain, beyond the current existing GW Open Science Center (GWOSC). Common frameworks such as Rucio and RucioFS would allow less experienced data analysts to easily access and browse experimental data, and bridge the gap for multi-messenger analysis typically performed by scientists belonging to different astrophysics domains and astronomers.",

      "Summary": "With the goal of overcoming the fragmentation of training resources across Research Infrastructures (RIs) and the Science Clusters, themTeSS-Xproject will enhance the existing open-source TeSS platform  - developed by ELIXIR specifically for building aggregator training portals, and currently used in ELIXIR and PaNOSC training portals - to natively support federation. Such a fully-featured open-source multi-tenanted training platform is expected to be an innovation for building a federation of portals to help break down barriers between thematic communities, promote a more cohesive European research community, and promote FAIR and open training.\nThe project strives to support the federation of training catalogues using a multi-tenancy approach, and enabling cross-instance content exchange. This will allow RIs and their communities to maintain tailored catalogues with distinct identities, while simultaneously benefiting from a shared global pool of resources.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nMany RIs and EOSC projects have limited training catalogue capability beyond sparse, outdated lists on web pages, while cross-portal exchange has been discussed but not practised. Fragmentation of resources hampers the reuse of valuable training materials and limits the dissemination of events and learning pathways. Additionally, the need to customise and maintain separate portals for each RI results in duplicated efforts and inefficiencies, reducing the overall sustainability of training resources in the European research ecosystem. The main challenge of the project is thus to enable the federation of catalogues, support cross-discipline training resource exchange and celebrate and maintain catalogue unique identity.",
      "Solution": "mTeSS-X will extend the TeSS platform by introducing multi-tenancy, allowing multiple communities to maintain distinct training catalogues within a shared instance, while preserving their individual identities. Each community will have a tailored view of the global catalogue (with custom look, features, content and integrations with other services), giving the appearance of a standalone portal, while benefiting from shared content and automated harvesting. This means that, for instance, in a Science Cluster portal, RIs would retain their own catalogue identity while promoting cross-RI, and/or cross-cluster sharing. In this respect, it will be demonstrated that merging the ELIXIR and PaN-Training portals into a single managed instance can present them as independent portals while still benefiting from shared content.\nThe project will also implement TeSS-X plugins to facilitate seamless content exchange between catalogues implemented as separate instances, enabling communities that run their own portals to participate in cross-catalogue resource sharing. This innovative approach will optimise both portal operation and training material dissemination across disciplines.\nMixing and matching these setups will enable cross-disciplinary training knowledge exchange, and will optimise portal operation, while serving training providers and consumers.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By fostering the federation of interoperable training catalogues, mTeSS-X will significantly enhance the findability, accessibility, and reuse of high-quality training resources. The project will improve the sustainability of training portals by reducing operational duplication and enabling resource-sharing across portals. The adoption of FAIR principles and open training practices will ultimately lead to a more efficient and impactful training ecosystem, benefiting both training providers and consumers: training providers will have their training resources propagated across catalogues and disciplines. Training consumers will have the availability of a much higher amount of FAIR training resources across scientific disciplines.",

Film analysis has been prevalent and institutionalised within film studies and history for numerous decades; they now engage a diverse array of academic disciplines, including sociology, media studies, educational sciences, political science, or theatre studies. TheOASISproject -Open Audiovisual Science Innovation Scheme- focuses on the analysis, enhancement, archiving, and dissemination of video corpora for research within the Humanities and Social Sciences. The project promotes Open Science methodologies and facilitates the development of innovative tools tailored for video research, ultimately enriching the research landscape.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service\nLeading research in Humanities and Social Sciences on audiovisual corpora entails confronting significant challenges related to FAIR principles and openness. These challenges include devising methods for hosting and archiving audiovisual materials, mastering tools for qualitative and quantitative data mining and analysis, including AI technologies, and formulating strategies for the dissemination and valorisation of video data, both within and beyond the academic sphere, all while addressing the particular format and copyright concerns associated with images and videos.",
      "Solution": "To meet these challenges, OASIS will develop an active network that brings together researchers from different European countries who are managing and working on online video corpora. This network, gathering over 200 researchers, will build upon the established experience of theHuma-Num CANEVAS consortium. In partnership with CANEVAS and other entities across Europe, OASIS broadens these collaborative efforts, with the aim of developing open-source and interoperable tools tailored for audiovisual corpora, and fully integrating the Science Cluster model and the EOSC ecosystem.\nSpecifically, the OASIS project will facilitate the translation and customisation of these free and open-source tools to suit the needs of new European communities.\nBuilding upon these initial steps, OASIS will develop educational resources in four languages - French, English, Croatian, and Romanian. Training courses and events will be organised, addressing researchers and doctoral candidates who aspire to undertake research involving audiovisual corpora. They will be designed to empower new research communities and to help them assimilate open tools, standards, and best practices for conducting research on audiovisual corpora in SSH domains.",

The ultimate goal is to create cost-effective discovery tools in multiple EU languages, improving access to and visibility of social science research for a diverse group of users, from expert audiences to policymakers.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science Service\nThe ONTOLISST project addresses the challenge of how digital European and international social scientific archives construct realities through thematic assignments in their metadata ontologies. Currently, there is a lack of streamlined, multilingual tools to assign topics and concepts across social scientific data from various archives, which impedes data discoverability and accessibility for diverse audiences. The project team's analyses of the ontologies provide a basis to interpret thematic metadata systems that are often taken for granted, even though they are a product of specific languages, are historically formed and discipline-based practices.",
      "Solution": "ONTOLISST proposes to develop the Light Social Science Thesaurus (LiSST), a controlled vocabulary of approximately 100 terms organised into two hierarchical layers. This thesaurus will be used to create a gold standard corpus for automated or semi-automated topic assignment in research data repositories, leveraging annotated samples of social scientific (meta)data in Finnish, English, French, and Hungarian.

      "Summary": "The OPAL project aims to advance the semantic infrastructure for astronomy by creating an ontology portal, as a centralised repository for vocabularies and ontologies. Astronomy has long benefited from theInternational Virtual Observatory Alliance - IVOA, which promotes data interoperability within the field. However, these vocabularies remain confined to the IVOA ecosystem, limiting their application in related disciplines, such as heliophysics and planetary sciences. The project, in collaboration with theOntoPortal Alliance, will expand the use of IVOA vocabularies across astronomy and neighbouring fields, enhancing data sharing, reuse, and interdisciplinary collaboration.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science Service, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThe astronomy community is recognised for itsVirtual Observatory infrastructure - IVOA, which enables interoperability and, in turn, smooth data sharing and reuse within this ecosystem. A key piece of this interoperability framework is the development and maintenance of vocabularies, as managed by the Semantics Working Group of the IVOA. Thanks to, among others, the EU funded Europlanet and ESCAPE programs, IVOA vocabularies spread to neighbouring disciplines (such as planetary sciences, heliophysics and particle physics). However, these vocabularies are still siloed in the IVOA framework.",
      "Solution": "The OPAL project aims to design and set up an ontology portal, as a centralised Semantic Artefact Catalogue (SAC) for astronomy. The project will partner with the OntoPortal Alliance to re-use and customise the OntoPortal SAC technology. An OntoPortal instance offers a rich description of the metadata of the artefacts, and various advanced ontology-based services, such as browsing, searching, visualising, computing metrics, annotating, recommending, assessing FAIRness, as well as receiving community feedback and change requests. OPAL will establish the OntoPortal instance for astronomy, which will collect vocabularies and other \"semantic artefacts\" (SA) from the areas in the ESCAPE Science Cluster, including the Earth’s near-space environment, the early Universe, space physics, planetary sciences, stars and exoplanets, the interstellar and intergalactic medium, galaxies, compact objects (e.g., pulsars), cosmic rays, cosmology, and particle physics.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By collating all the ESCAPE fields vocabularies and ontologies into a single portal, OPAL will enable semantic interoperability across various astronomy databases and applications. It will use common and coordinated FAIR assessment methodologies, and will improve data discoverability through consistent annotations. By enhancing the semantic infrastructure of astronomy, the ontology portal will thus enable researchers to discover and use data more efficiently through standardised vocabulary and ontology resources. The portal’s FAIR-compliant services will improve data discoverability and interoperability across various sub-disciplines within astronomy and related fields, supporting more comprehensive, interdisciplinary research.",

    "Project_content": {
      "Science cluster": "ENVRI - Environmental Sciences",
      "Summary": "Plant phenology is the seasonal progression of plant activity through stages of dormancy, active growth, senescence, and back to dormancy (Richardson et al. 2018). It is a key ecological parameter directly related to ecosystem processes and ecosystems-climate relations (Penuelas et al, 2009) and impacted by climate change and consequently linked to carbon and water cycles at ecosystem scale (Linderholm 2006). The projectOpen and FAIR Integrated Phenology Monitoring Systemaims to revolutionise the monitoring of plant phenology of terrestrial ecosystems through the design, development, and testing of an innovative phenological camera, coupled with a comprehensive post-processing software platform using open science and FAIR data practices. The project seeks to overcome traditional monitoring limitations, thereby enhancing data interoperability and accessibility for researchers, journalists, and the general public alike.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Industry cooperation, Citizen science, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nDespite the recognised significance of plant phenology - underscored by its classification as an Essential Biodiversity Variable - traditional monitoring methods often rely on infrequent visual observations, leading to challenges in data sharing and interoperability. Although advancements in satellite and remote sensing have facilitated large-scale monitoring, the current European PhenoCam network relies on a specific commercial camera (StarDot NetCam SC5) that is not updated to the new standard protocols, and is no longer produced. This hinders long-term data collection and compromises the quality of digital data flow. There is a strong need for a clear standard protocol, the optimisation of the processing routines for a Real Time phenology calculation, and the FAIR principle implementation to link images to the final product and all the metadata needed.",
      "Solution": "The project aims to solve these main issues by supporting and promoting the implementation of the Phenocam measurements and an open science service to produce open access and FAIR phenology observations. It will do so by designing and developing a new phenological camera that operates on open protocols, thus providing detailed build-up instructions for potential industrial production. This camera will ensure the longevity and adaptability of monitoring efforts. Secondly, the project will implement a full data cycle, from the images quality evaluation to the final products, with special care about the FAIR principles and full metadata provision, to meet the standards required by Research Infrastructures (RIs). The processing procedures will be integrated into the ICOS Ecosystem Thematic Centre, connected to the ICOS Carbon Portal to serve both research RIs and interested citizens.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The project will integrate the lessons learned in the phenology monitoring activities, as well as the knowledge of established RIs, such as ICOS, in data treatment and FAIRness, into an Open Science platform that will help to more easily deploy a network of phenocams across RIs, and offer a centralised and standardised service to create user ready products.The project results will help to facilitate science through a more easy data findability and accessibility, a continuous update of the results, a Near Real Time provision of the images and derived metrics, and a standardisation and interoperability among the different RIs in ESFRI and with the other international initiatives, while also engaging citizen scientists and educational institutions to foster broader community involvement in phenology research.",

      "Science cluster": "Other",
      "Summary": "Metal additive manufacturing (MAM), central to Industry 4.0, has drawn significant interest in sectors such as medical, aerospace, energy, and automotive. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to concerns over inconsistent material properties and a lack of full understanding of how novel microstructures impact performance. To address these challenges, theOpenCorrAMproject will investigate the corrosion behaviour of additively manufactured materials, such as austenitic stainless steels, nickel-based superalloys, and titanium alloys. Using high-resolution microscopy, microcapillary electrochemical techniques, and surface analysis, the project will study passive layer formation and breakdown. By comparing AM materials with conventionally manufactured ones, it will provide new insights into corrosion science. Project findings will benefit industry, research, and policymakers by improving material performance, sustainability, and safety.\nThe project team will develop a comprehensive, open-access database that interrelates processing, (micro)structure, and performance of AM alloys, with focus on corrosion aspects. This database will advance the state of knowledge, foster innovation in materials science and engineering, and help overcome barriers to the broader implementation of MAM technologies.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Industry cooperation, Main RI concerned, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThe growing adoption of MAM faces significant hurdles, particularly the high variability in material properties and the unclear connections between novel microstructures and their performance. This inconsistency limits the full-scale implementation of MAM across industries requiring reliable corrosion resistance, such as aerospace and energy. The need for a systematic approach to understanding the corrosion behaviour of additively manufactured materials is crucial for fostering confidence in their use.",
      "Solution": "Employing advanced high-resolution and microcapillary electrochemical techniques, OpenCorrAM strives to create an open and comprehensive database of intercorrelated results in the different fields of MAM performance analysis, that catalogues the corrosion characteristics of various additively manufactured materials. These investigations serve to provide exceptional insights into micro and submicron structural details, as well as the electrochemical and corrosion properties. Machine learning techniques will analyse the data, establishing relationships between microstructural features and corrosion behaviours, thereby enhancing predictive capabilities in materials performance.",
      "Scientific Impact": "OpenCorrAM not only enhances the scientific understanding of corrosion in additively manufactured materials but also revolutionises the field through the establishment of an open-access knowledge base.\nBy enabling access to a broad collection of data and findings, and by integrating machine learning techniques to analyse data and identify relationships between microstructural features and corrosion properties, OpenCorrAM helps standardise methods and approaches in corrosion studies related to AM materials, responding to the widely recognised strong need to open corrosion data to develop and feed predictive models in corrosion science. The project thus fosters collaboration and innovation, driving advancements in corrosion studies and supporting the MAM industry’s growth.",

      "Summary": "Lexicon and grammar are essential to communication, spoken or written, which is more efficient if lexicon and grammar follow the orthography rules of the standardised language. Good quality writing is considered a social advantage since it reduces possible misunderstandings in communication. It is part of a person’s social capital.\nOpravidlo 2.0aims to bring a beta-version online proofreading service,Opravidlo, into its operational phase. The project contributes to the evolution of Czech automatic proofreading by integrating AI with expert linguistic rules, making efforts to improve recall while maintaining precision. With over 161,000 monthly users, it corrects spelling, grammar, and typesetting errors with high precision, contributing to Open Science and aiding both native speakers and foreigners. Opravidlo 2.0 will enhance recall and precision, empowering  users from different linguistic backgrounds to communicate more effectively in Czech.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nMaintaining high precision in automatic proofreading while improving recall is a critical challenge. Current systems, including Beta Opravidlo, effectively identify spelling and grammatical issues but face limitations in covering all orthographic phenomena. Low recall can lead to user dissatisfaction, as incomplete error detection is problematic for a wide range of language users.  The risk is that users will lose trust in the tool and refuse to use it. Most current tools are outdated (over 15 years old) and may not account for shifts in formal Czech, such as influences from social media or the introduction of new words.",
      "Solution": "Opravidlo 2.0 plans to combine the current rule-based system with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, enhancing both recall and precision. New neural network models will be developed and trained for different proofreader modules, which will refine error detection across areas like punctuation, grammatical agreement, and sentence syntax, and neural models will also be applied to the explainability module.\nIn the frame of the project, a set of formalised grammar rules will be published. This dataset can be adapted for languages with similar orthography rules, together with a corpus of corrected texts obtained with the users’ prior permission, and including Opravidlo 2.0 suggestions, applied rules, and information about whether the user accepted the correction.\nThe tool will also expand its utility with an internationalised interface to support Czech language learners from diverse backgrounds, including speakers of Slovak, Ukrainian, Russian, and English.\nAll relevant data and methods will be published mainly via CLARIN ERIC and DARIAH ERIC.",
      "Scientific Impact": "Opravidlo 2.0 will contribute to Open Science by publishing its grammar rules and anonymised corrected texts via the CLARIN infrastructure. This will enable linguistic analysis, teaching, and tool development across languages with similar orthography systems. The project’s hybrid AI approach aims to set a new standard for proofreading technologies, benefiting both public services and future linguistic research. Also, a high-precision proofreader will serve the public good for all age groups of native Czechs and accelerate the integration of immigrants to Czechia.\nAll materials will be released via the CLARIN infrastructure. The published material can, among others, serve for linguistic analysis, language teaching, and training and evaluation of automated proofreaders in different languages.",

This lack of visibility not only affects the effectiveness of individual projects but also hinders the overall growth of the EOSC. As the landscape of research continues to evolve, bridging this awareness gap is crucial for fostering a culture of openness, collaboration, and equitable access to scientific resources.",
      "Solution": "The OSPARK curriculum encompasses foundational principles of evidence-based marketing, modern media utilisation, and innovative outreach techniques that extend beyond traditional scientific publications. Participants will engage in practical exercises, exploring various outreach formats such as videos, science slams, and social media campaigns tailored to specific target audiences.\nThroughout the bootcamp, a community-based and agile methodology will be employed, integrating feedback and case studies from existing RIs and Open Science initiatives. This collaborative approach ensures that the training remains relevant, effective, and responsive to the needs of the participants, ultimately empowering them to implement these new skills in their day-to-day work.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The OSPARK project holds the potential to dramatically increase the visibility and effectiveness of Open Science initiatives, including RIs, the Science Clusters, grassroots communities and more.

The challenge lies in improving user interaction and data retrieval efficiency, enabling a wider range of users to navigate this expansive knowledge base effectively.",
      "Solution": "PaN-Finder is a prompt based search system, similar to ChatGPT, which will include a UI interface and underlying infrastructure. It will adopt state-of-the-art AI technologies (including Large Language Modelling - LLM, AutoEncoders, and Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG), and pair them with Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies. As a result, the PaN-Finder tool will have the capability to understand both summative and exploratory questions, providing meaningful responses that summarise a vast knowledge pool and provide references to relevant resources. Embedding this innovative feature in the existing PaNOSC Data Portal, the project aims to stimulate usage within the PaN community and accelerate its adoption rate.",
      "Scientific Impact": "PaN-Finder will significantly improve data findability and accessibility, and will incentivise RIs to provide higher-quality data with well defined metadata, resulting in higher reusability of data. Open Science research will thus be enhanced, by promoting the adoption of FAIR principles across the research community, and enabling a wider audience to perform AI assisted, intelligent, user-friendly searches on the PaN knowledge. PaN-Finder will generate invaluable intelligence on PaN data, which will be instrumental in developing comprehensive guidelines for data curation and enhancing existing metadata. By facilitating better data discovery and curation practices, the project will accelerate scientific progress and collaboration, ensuring that high-quality data with enriched metadata are easily accessible for future research.

      "Solution": "The project will employ the Comparative Agendas Project's text-as-data methodology to analyse parliamentary debates of all the 27 parliaments, consisting of more than 7 million speeches, given in more than 20 languages, by automatically coding the agenda of each speech and transforming the ParlaMint corpora into a structured and tabular dataset, available for complete download through CESSDA ERIC.\nThe project aims to further code each speech with the sentiment expressed, as well as cross-reference the data with the PartyFacts metadatabase on political party metadata and the V-DEM surveys on the state of democracies. With this enriched and fully-FAIR dataset, now suitable for quantitative research, it will be possible to acquire a comprehensive understanding of how political attention is distributed across policy areas by analysing topic and sentiment coding over an unprecedented number of parliaments for political science research. The dataset will be available through RIs, such as CESSDA, CLARIN, and DARIAH, along with a graphical user interface and API for broader accessibility.",
      "Scientific Impact": "ParlaCAP will revolutionise comparative parliamentary studies by providing a robust dataset for tracking political agenda-setting across European parliaments. Its open, FAIR data management approach will support a wide range of RIs and projects in social sciences, while promoting transparency in political discourse and accountability of legislative bodies. The findings will have societal relevance, fostering collaboration in political science and beyond.\nMoreover, the engagement activities foreseen in the frame of the project will provide services and accompanying tutorials to raise awareness of the political studies community and ensure that the project's results are FAIR for further application and research by scientists across various Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) domains.",

      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Industry cooperation\nAddressing the climate emergency requires a rapid transition to renewable energy technologies and a substantial expansion of the electricity grid. However, these infrastructures pose significant threats to biodiversity, primarily through mortality from collisions and electrocutions, with millions of birds and mammals affected annually. The loss of individuals can increase the risk of local extinction, undermining long-term conservation efforts and resulting in significant socioeconomic consequences, including human fatalities and costly infrastructure damage. To counter this, it’s crucial to prioritise environmentally sustainable planning that minimises impacts on wildlife and achieves zero net loss of biodiversity.",

      "Science cluster": "ENVRI - Environmental Sciences",
      "Summary": "Human-made climate change is one of the main challenges that current societies are facing. As the impacts become increasingly relevant, near-real-time monitoring of the climate, namely the evolution of variables such as rainfall and temperature, is something essential. TheRegional State of the Climate dashboard - RSOTCproject aims to create a web-based dashboard providing near-real-time climate data (maps and diagrams) for European political regions (e.g., NUTS divisions), showing the evolution of climate indicators as those used in the “State of the climate” (SofC) reports. It will enable users to visualise climate trends such as rainfall and temperature, applying FAIR principles to ensure open access, reproducibility, and transparency. The project leverages existing climate data, integrates advanced statistical tools, and enhances access for scientific analysis, policy-making, and public awareness.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service\nWhile State of the Climate (SofC) reports (e.g., WMO, C3S, AEMET, NOAA, CSIRO) have been gathering increased public attention, they often lack regional detail (such as time series and histograms) and do not typically follow FAIR principles: although data are usually open, the code and algorithms used for downloading and processing it are not, thus hindering reproducibility. Additionally, current reports tend to omit statistical insights, such as trend analysis or advanced filtering, which limits the understanding of long-term climate patterns vs. short-term variability.",
      "Solution": "The RSOTC project will provide a FAIR-by-design service that offers visual and statistical insights into climate trends at regional levels. In this respect, the RSOTC dashboard will allow users to explore regional climate data with unprecedented detail. All the assets used to build the whole workflow, from downloading the data to producing the figures, will undergo the FAIR principles. The dashboard integrates open-access data from ERA5 reanalysis and E-OBS gridded datasets, with open workflows published in open repositories, such as GitHub and Zenodo, for further analysis and reuse. The project also foresees the development of an API to be included in the service catalogue of ENVRI and integrated with the EOSC EU Node AAI and portal systems. This will allow project members to join the EOSC federation, and to bring data from the C3S Climate Data Store to the ENVRI ecosystem.",
      "Scientific Impact": "By providing tools for statistical testing and trend identification, the project will allow users to explore climate data with unprecedented detail, such as precipitation time series with a regional detail, and to apply statistical tools to test scientific hypotheses, a feature which is not available in other similar dashboards. This will allow identifying new trends on the extremes and other important statistics, but also other important features of the data that may have been overlooked by previous analysis. The dashboard also promotes collaborative research by allowing the scientific community to share findings and insights, thereby advancing climate science and fostering informed decision-making on environmental policy.",

By structuring data with standard vocabularies and ontologies, the project will enhance data interoperability, making FishBase more discoverable and accessible for both humans and machines. This shift will allow seamless data exchange across domains and enable more complex and meaningful data queries. In addition, it will enable richer, more meaningful and complex data queries and analysis by relying on semantic relationships between entities.\nAs a semantic web knowledge base, its contents can be queried using SPARQL. Furthermore, a dedicated API will be implemented as a versatile gateway for accessing the wealth of resources of the knowledge base in different formats and standards. Designed with REST principles, it will offer simplicity, scalability and interoperability, making it the ideal interface for developers, scientists and researchers.",

Exabytes of scientific (raw) data are managed with this technology and transferred worldwide for efficient distribution of data sets that need to reach end-users. However, existing workflows often require duplicating data to third-party systems to make it openly accessible. The projectStreamlining open data policies in Rucio data management platformaims to enhance Rucio by embedding open data policies directly into its core, enabling seamless data sharing without duplication, and supporting interdisciplinary research.",
      "Challenge": "Open Science project, Open Science Service, Citizen science, Cross-domain/Cross-RI\nThe growing need for interdisciplinary research, particularly in multi-messenger science, has highlighted the importance of sharing scientific data across institutions performing complementary research (infrared, gravitational waves, etc.). However, institutions often rely on archaic or error-prone methods for data sharing. Moreover, given that Rucio does not recognise open data as a main data type, experiments need to copy this data to other systems to make them FAIR, incurring extra costs for the storage of the copy of the data. The main objective of this project is thus to introduce native support in Rucio to manage open data, where embargo and public access policies can be defined, so a copy of the data is not needed to make data open.",
      "Solution": "The project proposes a paradigm shift: instead of duplicating data, Rucio will link open data directly at the source, incorporating FAIR principles natively into its architecture. By managing embargoes and public access policies within Rucio itself, scientific data can remain within its custodial storage while being accessible as open data. This approach not only prevents unnecessary duplication but also ensures long-term preservation using Rucio’s robust replication mechanisms.",
      "Scientific Impact": "The integration of open data support within Rucio will benefit a wide range of research infrastructures, from particle physics to astronomy and beyond. The project will reduce costs, improve resource efficiency, and lower the environmental footprint by minimising data duplication. Moreover, it will foster collaboration across institutions and disciplines, empowering the broader scientific community, including citizen scientists, to access and exploit data more easily, further advancing scientific progress.",
