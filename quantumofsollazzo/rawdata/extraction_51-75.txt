The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
·
Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Alasdair Rae
, Founder of Automatic Knowledge, former academic, and fundamentally the source of many maps you’ve seen in this newsletter – countless data journalists, cartographers, analysts, and yours truly, have all learned how to make maps thanks to Alasdair’s
tutorials (https://www.statsmapsnpix.com)and courses.
·
Before I close – you might remember that some time back I created some
road-colouring maps of London
that show roads coloured according to their suffix, i.e. whether they are
roads, streets, avenues, ways
, and so on. They sold really well, and I have only 2 left. I need to empty my loft so…
here’s a70% discountwhich basically will get you the map for a fiver (https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Puntofisso).

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Alasdair Rae
Alasdair (https://twitter.com/undertheraedar)is Founder of Automatic Knowledge Ltd (a UK-based company with a focus on geographic data analysis, research and training).
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
As part of my work with Automatic Knowledge, I do a mix of data analysis and research consultancy (with a focus on spatial data), training, and data sharing. As a window into my work, I also like to share things on twitter - mostly maps. For geo stuff I mostly use QGIS but I dabble with command line stuff too, just whatever works best. I also like to share methods and skills on my blog. I work with some very big and some very small organisations and I talk to my colleagues Elvis and Philip about work we've got on.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
This is a difficult question because but I tend not to look backwards or feel proud about things, but I did quite like the way my
Land Cover Atlas of the UK (https://figshare.shef.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/A_Land_Cover_Atlas_of_the_United_Kingdom_Document_/5266495)came together, and the resulting '
How much of your area is built on? (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41901294)' tool on the BBC website. This was a simplified piece of work for a mass audience, but the original piece of work in the Atlas was me trying to understand a dataset better and then share that with others, which is at the core of many of the things I do. Obviously, it wasn't perfect, and looking back I might have done a few things differently but it was an interesting experience and I learned a lot about how these things come together as well as practical things, from people within the BBC team such as Prina Shah (Visual & Data Designer) and Lucy Rodgers (Senior Journalist) to Mark Easton (BBC News, Home Editor). I did this while I was working as a Professor at the University of Sheffield and in the end part of this work led to me winning 'Stat of the Year' from the Royal Statistical Society (although I also received angry letters and emails from other people, just to balance things out, because that seems to happen when you write about land use).
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
In general, I look around me and see people doing so many amazing things and then feel slightly self-conscious about my own meagre skillset! Overall, I'm continually inspired by what I see on Twitter (despite the noise) and there are so many people doing amazing things, but over the past couple of years I've been so impressed by what Bin Chi (previously UCL, now at the University of Glasgow) has done in relation to linked data for the housing market, and particularly combining transaction information from the Land Registry Price Paid Data (PPD) and property size information form the Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) dataset. This is the kind of thing that can sound outrageously dry but in my view is the exact opposite - it's exciting, innovative and useful - and Bin is doing great work here.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
'Spreadsheet', because most of the time when I go to download data that's the form I find it in. But I also think 'important knowledge might be hidden here, so let's take a look'. So I suppose that means I think 'potential knowledge' when I hear 'dataset'.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Things will go wrong a lot when you work with data - and geodata seems to be even more like this because you also have to think about coordinate reference systems and why things are sometimes in the wrong place, the wrong shape, or both. In fact, things might go wrong so much that you'll be surprised when things go right. Also, lots of weird but not necessarily wrong things will probably happen and you won't always know why. You might never know why. Maybe that's just like life in general. I'm an eternal optimist so I still expect things to work first time, though when they don't I'm still not that disappointed - I see the problem solving as part of the fun. So, for someone new to all this I'd just say that it happens to everyone and that's ok. Being confused is fine.
Data is or data are...
I don't have strong feelings about this. I use 'is' and others use 'are', and that's fine. I think we should be pretty relaxed about these kinds of things because, after all, we is all in this together. My new mug proves that there are space for both views.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Francesco Piccinelli Casagrande
Francesco (https://twitter.com/f_picci_journo)is Content Manager at Evocon
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
There is no standard workflow. I usually ask myself a basic question (e.g., Do European Cohesion Funds work in Italy?), then I try to answer it using data. I try to collect as much data as I can, possibly via API. Then, I perform statistical analyses with R, visualize, and try to write a story that explains my findings. When I write for Wired Italy, I visualise data with Tableau. Otherwise, I do ggplot2 charts.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I am incredibly proud of
this story (https://www.wired.it/article/maneskin-segreti-successo-analisi-dati-grafici/)I ran about Måneskin. First, I tried to understand what is special about them. Secondly, I asked myself if they belong more to the Italian or the Anglophone musical tradition. To answer my questions, I downloaded data from Spotify’s API (thanks to the developers of SpofityR – the R package that allows you to run Spotify data on R) and visualised the results on Tableau. It is a bit complicated as a story, but I like to think that readers are smarter than most journalists believe.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I choose The Economist's
analysis (https://www.economist.com/interactives/graphic-detail/2022/01/29/what-spotify-data-show-about-the-decline-of-english)of more than 200,000 songs to see if English is declining in pop music. It is super interesting because it uses clustering techniques, advanced statistics (principal component analysis in mainstream media? Crazy stuff), and clever visualization solutions. Allowing people to listen to music in a chart defined a new standard for interactive data visualizations in digital newspapers. We can all learn a lot from that article.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
I think of a piece of marble you must carve to get a story. The lines of code I use are the chisel. The story is there, you just have to take the unneeded material away. Things become interesting when you realize that the piece of marble you have is not enough, but I guess this part is for another interview :D
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Always save your code and store it on GitHub, even if you think you are stuck. Maybe, in a few months, you want to go back to your idea, but you don’t remember what you did. No matter what, storing your code allows you to keep track of your work and formalise the lessons you learn over time. If anything, it will make you more productive: having scripts beforehand will prevent you from reinventing the wheel every time you open R-Studio.
Data is or data are...
Data is. Sometimes I think of data as a sort of philosophy I try to adapt to everything I do. Working with data makes you imagine things from an opposite point of view to demonstrate your theories (yes, I am talking about the null hypothesis). It doesn’t matter if you are into microeconomics or social media analytics: the principles of data at large are roughly the same. That’s also why I think of data as a unitarian philosophy that should permeate every aspect of the public sphere -- if not our day-to-day lives.

Valérie Ouellet
of CBC, where she is a Senior Data Journalist working in their Investigative Unit.
‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Valérie Ouellet
Valérie (https://twitter.com/valerie_ouellet)is a Senior Data Journalist at CBC News (Canada).
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My job is to report on national investigations with a data-driven focus for Canada’s public broadcaster, CBC News. I work with data from all sources: FOI, scraping, open data portals and exclusive datasets I build from scratch using news clippings, court filings, interviews, etc. My main tools are spreadsheets, SQL/Python code and QGIS, plus OpenRefine/Comet Docs for messy data. Once I have vetted key findings, I share them with 2-3 academics/experts and chase main characters, all for on-camera interviews. I write all my stories and present them on our online, radio and television platforms, with the support of a producer. Most data visualizations are created by a talented team of graphic designers and/or developers.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I just used data analysis to
document a manufacturer data dump of thousands of suspected injuries tied to breast implants (https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/breast-implants-health-canada-allergan-mentor-1.6312587)sold in Canada. The last time I analyzed this data was in 2018 as part of
the ICIJ’s “Implant Files” investigation (https://www.icij.org/investigations/implant-files/)". At the time, we suspected problems had been underreported for years, but couldn’t quantify the gap. When I dug back into the data in 2022, I found more than 5,900 new reports had been submitted to our federal health authority, Health Canada, by manufacturers on three dates - a ‘data dump’. Some reports dated back to the early 2000s, which goes against federal requirements and raises many questions on the accountability of our reporting system. Thanks to meticulous record-keeping, I was able to reuse my 2018 scripts to run my analysis quickly and put the story out as an exclusive. Proud that I trusted my instinct that there was more to this story and followed up.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
My deep admiration goes to investigative reporter Robyn Doolittle and data reporter Chen Wang
for their investigative series into Canada’s “Power Gap” (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-power-gap/). Their two-and-a-half-year project compared the overall representation, salaries and leadership positions of women and men in 244 entities in the country. It took careful research, hundreds of FOI requests and complex data analysis to put it all together. The way the series rolled out is also to be commended, with a steady flow of sector-focused stories over months and several “Behind-the-scenes” pieces where the team broke down their data collection, data analysis and methodology in full transparency.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A creative new way to approach, tell and visualize news stories, particularly to shed light on systemic discrimination, inequalities and social justice. A tool to better research and quantify many problems we hear about regularly as investigative journalists. A way to show sources that their lived experience has meaning for many more people, to connect the dots for our audience and to move the dial on big debates with exclusive information. An ironclad email requesting accountability from the “power that be”, with not just testimonies or allegations they can easily dismiss, but hard numbers they must address.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
It took me a long time - thank you Imposter Syndrome - to understand that a great data-driven story doesn’t need to involve dozens of bots, fancy interactive visualizations or three coding languages to be newsworthy and serve the public interest. In Canada, access to data at all levels of government is still limited, unfortunately. Many times, I filed great stories by being the first person to answer a simple question with reliable data - like how many prisoners had been infected with COVID or what are vaccination rates like in provincial correctional facilities - and all it took was one spreadsheet and meticulous research with a rigorous methodology. What matters is the story and what it reveals, not the tool. Robots are really cool, but first ask yourself: are they your best, fastest way of getting to that story?
Data is or data are...
The eternal debate! I do a bit of both? Data is in the newsroom and on-air, data are with academics, experts, statisticians and data scientists.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.

This is a shorter Easter-break version. But I really wanted to share this week’s six-questions interview with a data guru. This week, I spoke with
Colin Angus

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Colin Angus
Colin (https://twitter.com/VictimOfMaths)is a  Senior Research Fellow, at the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), The University of Sheffield
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
As a researcher my 'proper' work involves bringing together many datasets and building complex health economic models to estimate the impact of public health policies. But I also think descriptive epidemiology – just describing trends and patterns in health and related factors - is massively underrated. So alongside this research I have often done bits of analysis of various public datasets related to health. Since there is (sadly) little appetite from academic journals to publish this sort of descriptive analysis, I post graphs, code and commentary on Twitter. I do all this analysis in R, mostly because ggplot is amazing – powerful enough to create *almost* any graph you can imagine, but without being hellishly complicated.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I initially avoided COVID data, but then got lured in in April 2020 by one of my colleagues asking me a question about whether deprived areas had higher rates of COVID cases. Since then I've posted a *lot* of graphs and analysis (and
R code (https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19)) trying to make sense of what's going on, and in doing so learned a huge amount both technically about data processing and visualisation in R and also about what works well (and what doesn't) when trying to communicate data to the public. And hopefully along the way I've helped a few people to better understand the development of the pandemic.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I'm not jealous in the sense that there's no way I could have made it, but the
UK COVID dashboard (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/)really is an incredible thing. On a technical level, the amount of work required to pull such a huge amount of data from so many sources, process it and package it in a really accessible way so quickly absolutely boggles my mind. The fact that it also has an incredibly easy to use API so strange people like me can mess around with the data ourselves is just the icing on the cake. I *really* hope that we take some of that commitment to data accessibility into the future with other aspects of public health data.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
An opportunity to draw some new graphs and learn some new things.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Share. Your. Code.
I made a decision one day to do this with everything I post online. It felt like a big leap of faith at the time, but I have no regrets at all.
It does feel a bit scary at first, particularly when you are just getting started with a new tool, topic or dataset, but I guarantee you that there will always be someone out there who is more confused than you and who will appreciate you sharing how you've done things. And remember, the ugly code that works is *much* better and more useful than the beautiful code that doesn't.
Data is or data are...
Is. Emphatically is. I usually love a bit of tedious grammatical pedantry, but 'Data are' just sounds wrong to me and I'm glad the world seems to be slowly coming round to my way of thinking.

Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Sandrine Vieira
of Montreal-based newspaper Le Devoir.

Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Sandrine Vieira
Sandrine (https://twitter.com/sandrinevieira7)is a data journalist at Le Devoir
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My work consists of finding and telling stories with data. For example, I worked a lot on COVID-19 in the past year. I would look at the cases, hospitalizations, deaths and vaccination data of Quebec (the province of our newspaper) and other locations to find trends or anomalies. I mostly use Excel to clean and analyze the data and Datawrapper to create charts.
I also work on special data projects with my team, where I’m in charge of collecting the data, doing the research and writing the story. My team helps me with the data analysis and designing the visuals (with D3.js).
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Last year, the discovery of the remains of 215 Indigenous children buried at the site of a former residential school in British Columbia created a shock wave across Canada. I found an elaborate statistical report about missing children that frequented those residential schools. After lots of time reviewing the numbers, we came up with
a visual story (https://www.ledevoir.com/documents/special/2021-06-pensionnats/index.html)about everything that was documented about them. The exercise did not only put the numbers of that discovery into context, but showed how much information is still missing to this day due to lack of documentation at the time.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I really love the
Washington Post’s
project «
How Big Tech got so big: Hundreds of acquisitions (https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2021/amazon-apple-facebook-google-acquisitions/)». The story shows how the Big 4 - Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google - got to dominate the market by acquiring hundreds of companies over decades. For someone who doesn’t know much about tech companies, I was struck to see the magnitude of the transactions made in new sectors over time.
Also, I always love to see stories that require lots of research like this one.
The Post
team collected the data from multiple reports and studies, which definitely made me want to go dig into reports myself to do something similar !
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Literally anything! I truly believe that data doesn't have to be hidden in big databases that require hours of time to clean and crunch. I think data can take any form : a story could be based on a few numbers in a report or on data that you collect by yourself over time. With a bit of imagination, it can even be words - we made data projects about political promises during election periods and analyzed speeches to dissect words used during debates.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Take it one day at a time. Data journalism can be very overwhelming at first, considering all the tools, platforms and programming languages there is to explore. After a while, I realized that I simply couldn’t learn it all right off the bat - and that’s OK. Concentrate on getting better with data in general and master the few tools you need to use on a daily basis. The rest will come eventually. Also, never forget that at the end of the day, it’s the story that matters : practicing your journalistic skills is just as important!
Data is or data are...
Even if it’s technically plural in French, « Data is » just sounds better to me!

When Accuracy Isn’t Enough: Visualization and Game Design
"
Modeling typically starts with defining a metric to optimize and, often, this definition of “good” leaves something out. Boosting precision can create room for discrimination, optimizing profit may reinforce inequity, and bad behavior can hide behind good performance metrics. Data science offers many tools for optimization but consider defining the problem itself: what makes a solution desirable and what behaviors mean it works as intended? There’s no one answer with lots of work ongoing in this space (including a need to improve diversity in the discipline itself). However, consider two sometimes uncommon tools that might be able to help:
information and game design (https://towardsdatascience.com/when-accuracy-isnt-enough-visualization-and-game-design-48b95425130a).

Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or

·
Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Rosamund Pearce
, Visual Data Journalist at The Economist. As readers of Quantum of Sollazzo, you’ve probably seen her contributions to The Economist’s Graphic Detail section linked here.
‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Rosamund Pearce
Rosamund (https://twitter.com/_rospearce)is a Visual Data Journalist at The Economist
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I mainly work on our
Graphic Detail (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail)section, which is a collaboration with another data journalist who performs the statistical analysis and writes the copy, while I create the graphics and lay out the page. The elements evolve in tandem: giving something greater prominence in the graphics influences what’s written, and mentions of a category or place in the copy affects what I show in the graphic.
I use R for data cleaning, analysis and visualisation, QGIS for maps, Adobe Illustrator for laying out and polishing up the design, and D3 for things I can’t do elsewhere (like force-directed graphs).
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Unusual data visualisations can be eye-catching but also run the risk of being hard to understand, since readers are more familiar with tried-and-tested methods. So I’m always pleased when I create something that is both striking and intuitive, like our visualisation of
social distancing in bees (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/27/just-like-modern-humans-honeybees-avoid-each-other-amid-plagues). The diagram was also a lot of fun to design.
I’m also proud of
the newsletter (https://www.economist.com/newsletters/off-the-charts)that the data team launched last year. I enjoy writing about data visualisation and having a dedicated newsletter gives me a space to get into the nitty-gritty of designing charts without worrying that the topic is too niche.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I am constantly in awe of other visual journalists’ work. Among the other newsrooms I admire are Reuters for their
clear and clean diagrams (https://graphics.reuters.com/TONGA-VOLCANO/znpnejbjovl/), The Washington Post for their
gorgeous maps (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/mapping-disasters/), The New York Times for their
innovative data visualisation (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/28/opinion/climate-change-risks-by-country.html)and the South China Morning Post for their
beautiful print layouts (https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/lonelyGraphics/201303A106.html)and use of illustration.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
My mind immediately jumps to practical considerations. Is it in a format I can use? Is the source reputable? What type of visualisations could work with this type of data? Does it have the right coverage (time and place)?
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Where to start! I wish I’d learned R sooner, as it’s far superior to spreadsheets for most tasks. The ggplot package is also great for exploring different visualisation methods so you can get a quick idea of what works, even if I sometimes end up producing the visualisation elsewhere (for example with an interactive I will redo it in D3).
There are loads of little tricks in Adobe Illustrator that I wish I’d learned sooner. “Convert to shape” allows you to resize scatters without the circles distorting. The blend tool is useful for creating colour scales for maps. And if there isn’t a built-in way of doing something it’s worth checking to see if someone’s written a script for it.
Data is or data are...
After nearly three years at The Economist, I’m slowly coming around to “Data are”.

This paper explores Null Island, a fictional place located at 0∘ latitude and 0∘ longitude in the WGS84 geographic coordinate system. Null Island is erroneously associated with large amounts of geographic data in a wide variety of location-based services, place databases, social media and web-based maps. While it was originally considered a joke within the geospatial community, this article will demonstrate implications of its existence, both technological and social in nature, promoting Null Island as a fundamental issue of geographic information that requires more widespread awareness. The article summarizes error sources that lead to data being associated with Null Island. We identify four evolutionary phases which help explain how this fictional place evolved and established itself as an entity reaching beyond the geospatial profession to the point of being discovered by the visual arts and the general population. After providing an accurate account of data that can be found at (0, 0), geospatial, technological and social implications of Null Island are discussed. Guidelines to avoid misplacing data to Null Island are provided. Since data will likely continue to appear at this location, our contribution is aimed at both GIScientists and the general population to promote awareness of this error source.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.

Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Valentina D'Efilippo
Valentina (http://twitter.com/defilippovale)is a data designer
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I juggle many different things. So my days vary depending on whether I am consulting for a client, designing a dashboard, illustrating a book or teaching dataviz and infographic storytelling. When designing I usually receive the data research from my clients. I use Google Sheets to explore the data and often use rapid prototyping tools like Rawgraphs or Data Illustrator to plot the data. Most of the craft in my designs is carried out in Adobe illustrator and if I design an interactive display I work with Adobe XD and collaborate with developers.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Over the years, I have been lucky to get involved in some great projects and I collaborated with some awesome people – from theatre productions to books, and editorial artworks and interactive products. I am proud of many of these experiences and it's hard to pick one favourite project. But if I have to name only one, well it must be co-authoring and illustrating
The Infographic History of the World (http://www.valentinadefilippo.co.uk/portfolio/theinfographichistoryoftheworld/). The result of a collaboration with James Ball is a collection of 100 infographics which narrate the evolution of mankind and the planet. We created them in less than a year and, as you can imagine, it was a very intense experience but also very rewarding to see the book translated in more than 10 languages and being read and shared by people. The project has cemented my experience in this field and has opened up many doors.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Pretty much everything
Mona Chalabi (https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi)creates! I love the immediacy of her work and how she provides clarity to very complex and important topics.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A window into the world. An opportunity to learn/discover but also to express/communicate.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Embrace your limitations and transform them into assets. It can be intimidating starting out, you might feel you need to master everything from data analysis, to designing and writing. The reality is that most projects you see are the result of collaboration. So my advice is to focus on one specific area.
Dataviz is not magic, it is planning, researching, designing, failing/succeeding and showing up the next day to do it all over again. Document what you do, experiment, allow for feedback cycles in your work and be obsessive about your craft. Take pride in your work, but don’t take it too seriously. Above all else, have fun exploring. The important thing is to find YOUR process and respect the data.
Data is or data are...
Data is but...who cares? I don't think there is room for many absolutes in this field. My only rule is to respect the data and the audience...regardless of how they spell.

Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week.

”.
‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Federica Cocco
Federica (https://twitter.com/federicacocco)is a Statistics Journalist at the Financial Times
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I work for the FT’s statistics team, a subset of the data team that specialises in economics but we actually work on pretty much anything. We write news and analysis on economic trends, policy, demography, the labour market, commodities and a variety of other subjects and also assist other journalists, like Martin Wolf for example. We respond to the news which means my days are very different from each other but they generally involve looking at data on the OECD website, or financial terminals like Bloomberg and Refinitiv.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I like working on stories that combine a human angle with data because, you know, spreadsheets are people too! While I strongly believe a lot more stories should be backed up by evidence (in the form of data), equally a lot of data-driven stories still neglect the human angle. Through my work, I try to combine the two. I worked on
a story about how young people were affected by the pandemic (https://www.ft.com/content/0dec0291-2f72-4ce9-bd9f-ae2356bd869e)which I think perfectly encapsulates this principle.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I am a “scrollytelling” sceptic, mostly because I think it’s just a gimmick. But I enjoyed being proven wrong by
this ProPublica investigation on how much taxes America’s billionaires actually pay (https://projects.propublica.org/americas-highest-incomes-and-taxes-revealed).
If I say "dataset", you think of...
People, interactions, patterns. Datasets look like abstract numbers but through our stories they should come alive. I remember working on a monstrous dataset representing remittances, i.e. money sent by migrant workers to their families back home. I pictured them sweating in the kitchens of New York, in the building sites of Dubai, in care homes in Italy, in a field in Ukraine or working for a bank inside a skyscraper in Canary Wharf.
This was the result (https://ig.ft.com/remittances-capital-flow-emerging-markets/).
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
I know a lot of data journalists feel frustrated sometimes because the rest of the newsroom doesn’t see them as real reporters. I think attitudes are changing massively but as well as the culture needing to shift in our favour, I think we need to meet editors halfway. These are my tuppence worth on how we can work towards this.
1. I get the impression that many data journalists are more comfortable working on longer-term analysis projects rather than newsy scoops. But data stories can and should be newsy. They should have a top line, and not just allow readers to look up their postcode to see how their high street or local hospital is performing. They also need to make a broader point.
2. Don’t be a silo, build relationships with other reporters in the newsroom. There should be more crosspollination of skills!
3. Numbers and data are just the beginning. If you are writing about, say, consumer confidence going up, describe the queues outside a pancake shop in Tokyo.
Data is or data are...
Data is, because that’s what comes up colloquially. I think we should write like we speak - the most important thing is that things are clear. That said, I am an obsequious follower of the FT’s sub-editors and they say data are plural.

Horizon Chart Explanation
“
A Horizon Chart is a specialized type of chart for time series data. It is especially useful for showing data with large amplitudes in a short vertical space. The idea was introduced by Saito et al. in Two-Tone Pseudo Coloring: Compact Visualization for One-Dimensional Data. Panopticon commercialized and coined the term Horizon Chart. Like any novel visualization, one downside is the cost for your audience to learn and understand that chart. Therefore, I have built this
interactive visualization to help make it easier to understand how Horizon Charts work (http://www.horizon-chart-explanation.devinlange.com/).

reconstruct (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm)the approximate polygons of precincts from voter’s address lists that rely on the Voronoi diagram and Census blocks shapefile

“
Gerrymandering distorts the will of the people, but the basic math of geographic representation
makes it difficult to get rid of (https://demodexio.substack.com/p/how-to-get-rid-of-gerrymandering), unless we get rid of representation for geographic districts.
“
TL;DR: The problem is not getting rid of gerrymandering, it’s getting rid of it
while
keeping local representation.

#469: quantum of sollazzo – 24 May 2022
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
·
Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Ornaldo Gjergji
, a Data and Policy Analyst with the Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa, and member of the European Data Journalism Network.
·
This is a slightly reduced issue, as I’m travelling through Italy to attend a friend’s wedding. And, in the process,
getting slightly angry at the traffic (https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/1527337992305532962). In fact, I’m wondering about how transport data compares with other EU countries: the astonishing number of single-occupancy cars that have driven past me during peak hours in one of the largest urban areas in the country makes me think that there must be a better way. And yes, I was myself in a car, which is part of the problem (as well as being partly aware of what the problem is).
‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Ornaldo Gjergji
Ornaldo (https://linktr.ee/ornaldo)is a Data and Policy Analyst at OBC Transeuropa – EDJNet
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I work for OBC Transeuropa within the European Data Journalism Network. Most of our work revolves around European affairs, or national and regional comparisons at the European level. So a lot of the data I use comes from Eurostat or other EU’s open data portals, together with data from national public administrations.
I use mostly R and RStudio for data analysis. Given that I have been doing a lot of geocomputation lately, I am starting to integrate QGIS and Mapbox as well in my workflow.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
The piece of work I am most proud of is probably the one on
Erasmus+ and its inequalities (https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/europa/2021-12-28/erasmus-dos-velocidades-programa-ue-desigualdad_3348913/), which has  been the result of a transnational investigation with El Confidencial within the European Data Journalism Network framework. Working across newsrooms in different countries has been stimulating and very rewarding, and I really like how we managed to blend the quantitative data at the European level together with the personal experiences of individuals.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
There are many. I would like to mention the data journalism project that made me want to start this profession:
Life in the camps (http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-ROHINGYA/010051VB46G/index.html), published by Reuters. I read this article some 5 years ago when I was about to graduate, and it was probably my first encounter with data journalism. I just loved how information was conveyed in the article and my first thought was “I want to do things like these”. One day I will, eventually :).
If I say "dataset", you think of...
If we agree (big if) that “data” and “information” can freely be used as synonyms, I would say that a dataset is any given way to systematize information. I think of tabular datasets because those are the ones I use the most. But a dataset can come in many different shapes, even a pdf can be a dataset.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Instead of thinking about how to bring life to a large dataset, try to understand how data can serve a story by enriching its narrative, or giving context to personal stories or qualitative elements more broadly. In my experience this makes the workflow within an organization smoother, contributes to the realization of better data stories, and builds trust between the data unit and the rest of the newsroom.
Data is or data are...
Probably ‘Data are’ is more correct, but I am not a native, so I unapologetically say and write ‘Data is’ as it sounds more intuitive to me.

What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
Because I freelance, it means my daily data work varies a lot.
Sometimes I work with clients with a strong data department; they bring their own data and need help with the communication and visualization.
Other times I get to work with good communicators, like journalists. Then I am usually asked to support in things like data collection strategies, structuring and cleaning spreadsheets, or creating visualizations.
I also collaborate with local activists to free up data, particularly on housing rights in Venice (Italy),  and design public activities, games and “data walks” to share that data with the community.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
My first data investigation, at Uni 10 years ago. It was a group work about surveillance tech funded by the EU and the public money flowing to privacy-invasive projects. I had to learn scraping, Xpath queries, and Gephi - thanks to the talented data journalist Adriana Homolova who was in my group.
At that time, learning these things made me feel like I was conjuring up awesome magic I didn’t think I could be capable of. This feeling got less common with age and experience, but whenever it happens again, my mind goes back to that project when I felt it first.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Oh, there are so many, it is hard to pick one! From a storytelling point of view, I love
Bussed Out (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study)by the Guardian. I feel it is a perfect mix of data, engaging writing, photos and videos all intertwined together magnificently.
In terms of tools, I am in awe with
Elvis Defence tenders exposed (https://defence.tenders.exposed/), which helps journalists navigate the complex world of public procurement data to find juicy stories.
And I really wish I had done some more data physicalization projects, like the works by
Matteo Moretti (https://matteomoretti.com/),
Domestic Data Streamers (https://domesticstreamers.com/)and
Jose Duarte (https://www.instagram.com/joseduarteq/).
If I say "dataset", you think of...
… oh, how much cleaning will it need?
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Embrace ambiguity, embrace fuzzy categories: not everything needs to be simplified, perfectly coded and standardized!
Data is or data are...
I say “data is” out of habit. In writing, though, I try to correct myself: data is indeed plural, not only in terms of grammar.

Well, COVID caught me in the end. As I write, I've tested positive for five days in a row, but I'd already been having symptoms for a week, so I hope it's not going to last much longer. I'm always a late adopter, am I not? Luckily, it's very mild, with a sore throat and some headache, but my reptilian temperature of 34.7C is not increasing.
Having to stay at home, I managed to spend some time playing with the radio and I even built my first homebrew vertical antenna, using a collapsible 10m pole, with which I managed a brief contact with Chechnya, which is over 3,000km from my location. Not bad at all for a piece of wire attached to a pole. If you're into ham radio, please let me know – it would be nice to have others to share this hobby with.

Rachael Dottle
Rachel (http://twitter.com/rachaeldottle)is a graphics journalist at Bloomberg News
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My daily data work goes something like: open 10,000 tabs of research papers, news stories, data sources, and documentation on the topic of my current story or project. I obsess over how I’m probably not depicting enough nuance in my data visualization for whatever I’m working on.
When I recover, I analyze, clean data, sketch and make. I like to use R and the tidyverse for quick sketches.
I’ve been using svelte as a framework for building interactive graphics since I joined Bloomberg. Recently, I’ve been relying less on D3, but it’s still there, too. I’m tool agnostic and I will use anything and everything to make the thing I want to make.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I’m proud of my most
recent piece (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-explainer/)for Bloomberg on US student loan forgiveness and the complicated situation millions of borrowers are facing as Biden weighs how much to forgive and for whom. This one involved a lot of Department of Education data and I think the data itself was somewhat straightforward but I tried to present the facts in an engaging way with a series of visuals.
I myself have student loans so it was a project I pitched to alleviate some of my anxiety about the limbo I’m in. I feel like getting into the topic through research and data helped me. I did a lot of piecing together datasets from various financial reports and so while the data is not that complicated it took some time to put together. I used R, Adobe Illustrator, svelte and D3.js for this one.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I was really impressed with all The Washington Post graphics and data coverage on the US abortion access news, the effects of a Roe v. Wade reversal and who is most impacted. It’s hard to keep track of all the state differences in laws and the data isn’t widely available, a team would have to collect and maintain it themselves. It’s a lot of data work and fact checking. This
piece (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2022/abortion-rights-protections-restrictions-tracker/)in particular has so much detail tracking everything.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
That collection of different recorded cat meows. Is
this (https://zenodo.org/record/4008297#.YoPAc5PMLFw)it? That’s a dataset.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
I wish I’d learned earlier that you don’t have to do everything perfectly to do the data visualization and data analysis you want.
You don’t have to first be a Python or R expert to get things done. You can be a mediocre coder, that doesn’t make your analysis or visualization less good if the analysis is sound, it’s sound.
Use whatever tool you’re most comfortable using, it could be Excel or literal drawings. If you make a thing that tells the story accurately and with solid data work, that’s still a valid methodology. Reproducibility is important, but don’t let the high barriers to entry of certain programs stop you from pursuing your work.
Data is or data are...
I don’t care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I use both.

#472: quantum of sollazzo – 14 June 2022
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.

Thanks to COVID (10 days positive… and counting), I had some time at home, which I spent, among other things, getting started on creating a basic cartogram or
hexgrid map of the ~1500 NUTS3 areas in Eurostat
. It’s a work-in-progress or, rather, work-that-I’m-not-so-sure-whether-to-progress :) If you think this might be useful, let me know, and I’ll keep finalising it and share it as open source.

I really enjoyed taking part in a
panel about AI at the BBC (https://twitter.com/bbcdatalab/status/1535006121471139858). Well, except I had to miss the drinks part thanks to said COVID… however, the discussion, about
responsible AI in public services
was pretty good, with Myrna from Ocado and Bill from the BBC giving incredibly interesting perspectives to compare with my own. Apparently, a recording will be shared soon so stay… tuned. Yes, the feeling is pretty much Big Rottweiler Brother is watching.

Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Giorgio Comai
of OBCT/EDJNet. His data wrangling tutorials are among my favourites.
·
Speaking of EDJNet, in the second half of 2022 they will launch a series of
free introductory courses to data journalism
in collaboration with Dataninja (whose co-founder Donata Columbro was on our “Six Questions” in issue 448). The best part is that they are entirely co-designing the courses, and your opinion is highly valued –
just fill in this survey (https://dataninja.typeform.com/to/x2Dcscvm). The courses will all be in English.
‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Giorgio Comai
Giorgio (https://twitter.com/giocomai)is a data analyst and researcher at OBCT, crunching data for EDJNet
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I think of all of us working with data as a big hunter-gatherer society. Sometimes our work resembles that of gatherers, i.e., we rely on open data or pre-existing datasets. In other occasions, we are more like hunters.
In my stereotyped image of such societies, there are folks who remain somewhere quiet in the shadows, building the tools that others use for hunting and gathering, processing the food they bring home, and making sure it’s of good quality. This is what I mostly do nowadays.
In brief, I spend my working days with the RStudio IDE in front of me.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Besides
double-checking datasets (https://edjnet.github.io/european_routes/), it’s really the tools and tutorials that I feel are my most useful contribution in the data space, even if - due to time constraints - they are never quite as complete as I wish they were. For example, I am quite happy with how
an R package I made (https://edjnet.github.io/tidywikidatar/)to streamline the retrieval of data from Wikidata has been maturing. But I am also really fond of woefully underdeveloped projects, such as when I began working on a
modern implementation of the Risk Characterisation Theatre (https://mobile.twitter.com/giocomai/status/1387765177676976136): the package I started developing at the time is barely functional, but I still look at it as a meaningful contribution to the ever-important debate on how to most effectively communicate risk and uncertainty.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I admire a lot R packages with elegant APIs, such as
gganimate
or
rayshader
. At first, animations and 3D renderings such as the ones they produce may just look gimmicky, but the APIs themselves push you to think more consciously about space, time, and layers in your data, which is good. Data-based animations still struggle to find their place in “serious” data visualisation, but I feel their time will come, perhaps as a partial replacement for limited interactivity or as an intermediate step towards data physicalization.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
… its authors. Who collected the data, and why, and… how did this dataset reach me? Did I produce this dataset myself from a combination of sources? Was it hunting or gathering? No matter the response to these questions, even if it’s nicely shaped (particularly if it’s nicely shaped) , even if I created it myself (particularly if I created it myself!), I look at it with suspicion.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Testing. As soon as you decide to use a dataset, throw some quality tests at it to check for consistency. When you process data, introduce automated testing at different steps of the data-processing pipeline (this can be done even if you are working with spreadsheets). You end up asking yourself better questions about the dataset, you are often forced to clarify what each data point actually represents, and you substantially reduce the risk of getting things wrong. But of course, you should also be suspicious of your own tests, don’t rely on them too much.
Data is or data are...
Here’s an important truth about data, hidden in plain sight in this very question you keep asking: different people look at the same question, even starting with the same data, and, in all honesty, to the best of their knowledge and capabilities, will reach a different answer.
In situations when there are different legitimate ways to look at the same question, as data analysts, we should mainly take one of two roads. Either we clarify and qualify the question, until we feel we would all reach the same answer. Or we embrace and cherish complexity, outline and present our approach, and hope others will enrich our understanding with different approaches, different answers.

Six questions to...
Mahima Singh
Mahima ()is Data Editor at The Globe and Mail
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
As a Data Editor at the Globe and Mail, I deal with many different kinds of projects; from daily assignments, long-term projects to tools and training for the newsroom. I also focus on assisting the newsroom with their data needs. 
My weapon of choice is spreadsheets with a sprinkle of Python, but I am constantly working with different tools for projects.
My work mainly involves:
Getting data
: open-source, scraping, record requests etc.
Analyzing the data
: Code in Python or analysis in a spreadsheet
Visualizing the data
: Creating top-level charts and graphics in our inhouse tool
Finally, the fantastic folk on our visuals team create the visuals, treatment and interactives for our stories.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
One of my first projects at the Globe and Mail was
this analysis of the Supreme Court of Canada (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadas-supreme-court-is-off-balance-as-large-and-liberal-consensus-on/).
By regularly reading Supreme court cases, our justice writer noticed a shift in how the country's top judges interpreted constitutional rights. They wanted to prove this hypothesis quantitively.
Enter Mahima.
I had to create an algorithm to track the bench's ruling patterns and evaluate how conservative or liberal the judges were.
Initially, I wrote multiple scrapers to pull text from the cases and analyze them automatically. But we all know how finicky scrapers can be. I soon realized what we were tracking wasn't objective enough for our code. After some trial and error, we concluded it was best to manually read through all the cases and create our own database. Finally, after months of reading and rereading cases, during which it felt like I was in law school, we finally had our data.
Cue the analysis.
I did most of the analysis in google sheets itself. Since this was an exploratory project, we tried to analyze the data through multiple angles, many of which didn't make it into the final story ( A lesson for anyone working with big data sets: not all findings end up in the story)Towards the end of the project, we set up various meetings with a Data Scientist from Ottawa university to validate our analysis and act as a third pair of eyes.
This was a very fun project for me because it was also a crash course in Canadian law for someone who had just immigrated to the country.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I love to seek inspiration from projects outside the Wapo, NYT, Reuters multiverse. While these organizations have time and again set the standards for data-driven journalism, it's the projects from around the world (particularly Asia in my case) that really stick out for me.
Here are just a few of the many DataViz teams out there.
I'm a big fan of
Kontinentalist (https://kontinentalist.com/stories), which does data-driven stories from Asia.
And I never cease to be amazed by the investigative pieces by
Malaysiakini (https://www.malaysiakini.com/en/tag/special%20reportx)from Malaysia,
this interactive (https://workpointtoday.com/forest-interactive/)from
Thai news organization workpointtoday (https://workpointtoday.com/interactive/), and everything that the
South China Morning Post (https://www.scmp.com/infographic/)does.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
One of the building blocks of a data story/project.
It can take many shapes and sizes, but ultimately it is a source, and just like any source, you interview it to get insights.
Data, set, go!
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Be kind to yourself. The industry is forever changing. The constant barrage of the new tools, coding languages, and skill sets can get overwhelming, but it's okay not to know it all.
I have learnt that the best way to learn new skills is by incorporating them into your projects. There is something very empowering about going into a project, not knowing something and coming out the other side with skills you didn't have before.
Another major takeaway from my time in newsrooms is "Make connections." Like all journalism, data journalism, too, is a collaborative effort. If it takes a village, it makes sense to get to know the villagers. Building relationships with reporters keep you sane in the workplace and presents opportunities for projects across different beats and fields. Plus, it has the bonus of sharing skills and learning something new.
Data is or data are...
For me, it's Data is!
It is what it is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In May 2020, the European Commission published its biodiversity strategy, which included the aim to plant three billion new trees by 2030 to help tackle climate change and create jobs.
"
This
illustrated piece (https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/infographic/eus-3-billion-trees-by-2030-goal-where-we-stand/)shows that, well, 3 billion trees is actually a lot.

Législatives 2022 : la carte des circonscriptions qui ont basculé d’un camp à l’autre

Interesting new approach to visualizing changes in vote share per region based on hexmaps, although I'm not sure I really like it – I still think that spike maps (see below) are slighlty better at doing this, although they only work one party at a time.

This is brilliant.
A tool that allows you to use markdown to produce timelines (https://markwhen.com/), maps, and more.
LoudNumbers VCV library
Fancy synthesizing some data? The smart folks behind the Loud Numbers project have released a
plug-in library for VCVRack (https://library.vcvrack.com/LoudNumbers/LoudNumbers).
Duncan Geere of LoudNumbers also shared the following two links...
csv2midi
The
csv to midi (https://csv-to-midi.evanking.io/)online tool by Evan King basically turns a simply structured csv file (see instructions) into a MIDI file, which works great for quick sonification projects.
Data Mapper
But then Duncan wasn't satisfied, as he asked: "
what if you don’t want a MIDI file, you just want a list of notes in a given scale? Or “low”, “medium”, “high” volume settings? Or any other ordered list of categories?
"
So he built a tool that does just that –
Data Mapper (https://observablehq.com/@duncangeere/data-mapper)is an Observable tool that allows you to "
load in a CSV, give it an ordered list of values, and it’ll map your data onto this values from low to high.
"
Of course, this works for any data mapping purposes other than sonification (Duncan suggests colours).

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.

I read this pretty great blog post titled “
Wasting Time in Tech Interviews – ranting about crappy tech interview experiences (https://www.benjamistan.tech/2022/06/26/wasting-time-in-tech-interviews.html)”, which totally resonated.
Back in the days, the crazy interview process is one of the things that got me out of big tech: I don’t think I’d have ever been able to pass those 6-7 whiteboarding interviews. Beyond the fact that they are so frustratingly disconnected from the reality of the roles, I’m just not good at fiddly exercises on the spot.
But as I often say, they do select for one specific skill – the ability to commit. Committing to preparing algorithm knowledge on-the-fly, to the process, to the company, etc. They select amazing committers, not great on-the-job performers.

Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Christine Jeavans

Six questions to...
Christine Jeavans
Christine (http://twitter.com/chrisjeavans)is a Senior Data Journalist at BBC News
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I work in the BBC News Data Journalism team which is made up of journalists, data scientists, statisticians and data designers. We work on a mixture of daily news and longer-term projects, on a wide range of topics and often collaborating with colleagues across the newsroom. Datasets we use may be open source, academic or FOI / self-gathered.
On a typical day I would be using R for analysis and charts, sometimes Flourish too. Colleagues in the team have Python skills and I’m learning from them. As a team we use Dropbox, Jira and Github to keep track of our projects and to share the workload.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Like many data journalists, I spent much of the past two years covering the coronavirus pandemic. Early on, a link was established between
Covid deaths and deprivation (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19bylocalareasanddeprivation/deathsoccurringbetween1marchand31may2020#analysis-of-deaths-involving-covid-19-data)but I was intrigued by a later comment from the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty that places worst-hit by Covid had also had high Victorian child mortality. I talked to Dr Alice Reid at the University of Cambridge who has been mapping 19th Century population data, and
wrote a piece using her maps side by side with Covid mortality maps (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57730353). It was shocking to see how poverty-linked ill health still reaches down the centuries, despite so many advances in living standards and treatment.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
There’s so much great work out there - and one of the things I love about the data journalism community is that there is always something to take inspiration from. It’s quite old now but I still admire this piece from the Tampa Bay Times -
Why Pinellas County is the worst place in Florida to be black and go to public school (https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/chart-failing-black-students/). It shows how the state’s policy of re-segregration failed black children and builds a compelling case with the data - simply and very effectively. The piece was used as the introduction to the paper’s year-long  investigation which was a Pulitzer prize finalist. When you see that 154 children out of 160 at the worst school failed maths or reading it sends a chill down your spine for their futures.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A box of information to puzzle out. It’s exciting to discover what it will reveal and satisfying to find the right way of analysing it. However, as with the examples above, most of the datasets I work with represent people and it’s important to me to keep the human element in the writing, analysis and visualisation.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Never assume.  Always look at the data definitions, read the notes and warnings and ask a subject-matter expert for advice if you need to. It’s easy to get quite far down the road of analysing a dataset only to later find that it doesn’t mean exactly what you thought it did. Also, by really thoroughly understanding the data and its limitations, you get a better and more solid story.
Data is or data are...

EU Twinnings, my good old hack from the EU Datathon 2020, became the subject of a
data story on data.europa.eu (https://data.europa.eu/en/datastories/exploring-regional-similarities-eu-twinnings). I’m happy about this. The idea behind EU Twinnings was this: can we create a measure of similarity between different areas? Eurostat data was quite handy, as it is relatively granular. There is quite a bit of missing data to complicate things, but the idea is a proof-of-concept that broadly works. In the past year or so my weekends have mostly been occupied by improving it thanks to a little commission that I gained from the EU Publications Office, but the concept is all there to be expanded upon, so any feedback is welcome. EU Twinnings is live

Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Isaia Invernizzi
of il Post. Isaia is a journalist who pioneered the use of data in local news, particularly getting his newspaper “L’Eco di Bergamo” to use data to cover the early, tragic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardia. He’s now with the “Il Post” newspaper, which has a strong evidence-based ethos.
Oh, and I shared a live discussion about data with Isaia on Italian national radio :)·
The most clicked link last week, rather aptly given the heatwave, was

Six questions to...
Isaia Invernizzi
Isaia (https://twitter.com/EasyInve)is a journalist at Il Post
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I don't have a single workflow. I often start by searching for the latest data published by organizations or institutions to understand if there is a story behind it, or I ask myself a question and look for data that can give me an answer. I usually analyze them with Excel and visualize them with tools like Datawrapper, Fluorish or Tableau. I am increasingly using the data to find stories which I then follow with a reporting job, with field visits, interviewing people. It is truly inspiring and fascinating to use data in this way.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Surely my most important work was the
analysis on over-mortality in the province of Bergamo during the early stages of the coronavirus epidemic (https://www.ecodibergamo.it/stories/bergamo-citta/coronavirus-the-real-death-tool-4500-victims-in-one-month-in-the-province-of_1347414_11/). It was a very demanding job because at the time, at the beginning of March 2020, there was no reliable data to understand how many really died from Covid-19. We collected all the data from 243 municipalities to understand how many deaths there were compared to the average of the previous five years. This is a method that was then widely used in many other countries around the world, but which at the time had not yet been considered the only one to better understand the real dimensions of the tragedy.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
One of the works that I liked the most in recent years concerns the
reconstruction of the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa made by the New York Times in 2018 (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/08/world/europe/genoa-italy-bridge-italian.html). A team of journalists, engineers and technicians analyzed the videos of the collapse from which they extracted a lot of data to explain the causes of the accident. I would very much like to take a lot of time to work on such a large article in collaboration with technicians who can help journalists better tell the news.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
The first thing that comes to mind is that datasets often tell stories of people. In some ways, all analyses involve people or have an impact on them. For this reason, a lot of care is needed when analyzing datasets: it is often forgotten that what we think of as simple numbers actually have effects on people's lives.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
To ask ourselves many more questions: to find the data that are not there, that is missing, and also those that we do not realize we do not know. We must have an increasingly open and complete look at the news and data we need to work on a news or to tell a story. Often in the past I thought that having a dataset was everything and that it was enough to work on what we had in our hands, in fact I learned that analyzes cannot ignore the data that we lack.
Data is or data are...
Damn, you put me in a crisis. I believe that the wording "data is" is more correct, also because I think of data as a large world in constant motion.

Measuring Gender Inclusion
“
To reduce the barriers women-led businesses face in public procurement markets, we need to be able to identify women-led businesses and understand to what extent they are bidding on and winning government contracts. This includes an understanding of both the number and the value of the contracts, as well as their sector.  We can take these measurements as a baseline and then implement measures with the goal of improving these metrics over time.

What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I wish I had a routine (nah, just kidding). Sometimes I deal with datasets released by statistical offices, say Eurostat, sometimes it’s news I try to break with data, sometimes it’s my editors or me coming up with ideas, sometimes I cross different datasets to see if anything pops out. I do data prepping with LibreOffice or Google Sheets, I don’t deal with big data, and I visualize them with Tableau public.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I pazienti dimenticati (Forgotten patients) (https://forgottenpatients.com/). An investigation conducted by filing more than 200 Foia requests to local Nhs in Italy to gather informations about surgeries, exams, visits and cancer screenings postponed during the first wave of the pandemics. Turns out we had parts of the country with low pandemic incidence and high percentages of postponed healthcare services.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
It’s called Mai dati, it’s an investigation on abortion in Italy. More specifically, it’s an investigation on doctors and nurses refusing to perform abortion, as the law allows them in Italy. It’s a work by Chiara Lalli and Sonia Montegiove. They made no dataviz, but they wrote a book about it.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Something I need to visualize. Or maybe cross with another one. Vlookup is my friend.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Always cross different datasets, look for correlations that might expand your knowledge. And keep your dataviz as simple to understand as possible.
Data is or data are...
Since it’s Latin, data are.

Pretty Maps in Python
Pretty good tutorial (https://tech.marksblogg.com/pretty-maps-in-python.html).
"
The project only contains 425 lines of Python due to intense 3rd-party package use.
The map data is collected from OpenStreetMap using the OSMnx library. This library itself is made up of only 3,700 lines of Python as its relying on NetworkX. NetworkX wraps up functionality relating to complex networks and is made up of 78K lines of Python. NetworkX is largely the work of Aric Hagberg, an applied mathematician at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as well as Jarrod Millman who was once the release manager for both NumPy and SciPy.
Rendering is handled by vsketch, a project made up of 4.6K lines of Python and is based largely on the efforts of Antoine Beyeler, an entrepreneur based in Switzerland.
In this post, I'll walk through generating the following rendering of Tallinn's Old Town.

The Only Algorithm for Hard Problems: Shake and Pull Gently
"
(Or, “
regularized greedy algorithms and their applications (https://kazimuth.github.io/blog/post/shake-and-pull-gently).”)"
Which prompts me to ask: is "
switch if off and on again
" a greedy algorithm?
"
It occurs to me that there’s something I oughtta admit. It actually took me a bunch of tries to get that shot of the headphones coming untied. Most of the times I tried it didn’t work, or only worked partially, leaving me with some knots to undo by hand. Even if I can describe the technique in a simple way, actually applying it takes practice and skill.
That applies to all the algorithms I’ve talked about here. Neural networks, SMT solvers, Place & Route engines; none of these things are straightforward. The devil is in the details, and getting to know such details can be a life’s work. I don’t want to denigrate that work; just point out some shared themes.

The Bayesian Bootstrap
“
In causal inference we do not want just to compute treatment effect, we also want to do inference (duh!). In some cases, it’s very easy to compute the asymptotic difference of an estimator, thanks to the central limit theorem. This is the case of computing the average treatment effect in AB tests or randomized controlled trials, for example. However, in other settings, inference is more complicated. […]
The bootstrap is the answer! It is a very powerful procedure to compute the distribution of an estimator, without needing any knowledge of the data generating process.[…]
Can we do better? The answer is yes! The
Bayesian Bootstrap (https://matteocourthoud.github.io/post/bayes_boot/)is a powerful procedure that in a lot of setting performs better than the bootstrap.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
It was a public holiday in the UK, and I spent some time relaxing and seeing friends, so this issue of QoS is shorter than usual.

Average internet speed across Europe
The European Data Journalism Network has updated their
European high-speed broadband dashboard (https://github.com/EDJNet/internet_speed/tree/main/data)with new data (including new countries in Eastern Europe). They also offer a search function to see the time series of download speeds between 209 and 2022, with aggregations at country-, region-, province-, and city-level (for over 100,000 residents). The
dataset is openly available (https://github.com/EDJNet/internet_speed/tree/main/data).
Ornandlo Gjiergi has used the data to
look at the slow Internet speed in the Balkans (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Balkans-slow-Internet-and-unspent-cohesion-funds), which seem to point to badly spent EU cohesion funds, with Romania being the exception

Mass killings in America
“
Horrific shootings in schools and in public spaces such as movie theaters, grocery stores and shopping malls dominate the news, and most Americans believe this seemingly indiscriminate violence poses the greatest threat when it comes to mass carnage.
An analysis of data by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University (https://apnews.com/article/mass-killing-index-dashboard-379385321413), however, shows that these types of crimes, while terrifying, actually represent a small fraction of the mass killings in America.

The Rise of DataOps 🚀
“
Let’s face it — traditional data management doesn’t work. Today, 75% of executives don’t trust their own data, and only 27% of data projects are successful. Those are dismal numbers in what has been called the “golden age of data”.
DataOps promises to solve this problem, and it’s on fire right now (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-dataops-prukalpa-/).

Machine learning is on track to

I don’t think its calculation are accurate, but it does point to a broader problem: the energy footprint of our digital world, especially in the AI realm where power-hungry GPUs are used widely. What do you think?
This good

I rarely give big work-related announcements on here, but this one is something I'm really proud of and that is data-related in many ways. My team was part of a collaboration that
developed an AI model that is able to detect the presence or absence of Parkinson's Disease in images of brain slides
. Although this might sound a bit grim and far away from applicability, there are some good reasons why it's an important and rather exciting step. More in
this Twitter thread (https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/1564562912554909696)(with links to a technical report and open source code), and keep an eye on our public show & tell.

I will be away next week, so there will be no newsletter on the 13th. I hope you can resist a week without Quantum. Back with a likely double-whammy the week after next.

The most clicked link last week was
MoveMap (https://www.movemap.io/explore/us). A few of you asked whether we could do something like this for the UK. I suspect that the area is too small for some of the differences to be meaningful, but maybe at a European level? Not sure.
That also prompts me to ask a question: is there any other way you’d like to engage with one another? I tried setting up a subreddit for Quantum of Sollazzo, but it never caught on. Any suggestions would be welcome, as are general ideas on how to make the newsletter better.

Don’t impute all missing data: Missing Data Patterns
“
A missing data pattern (https://muratkoptur.com/MyDsProjects/MissingData/Analysis.html)is the structure of observed and missing values in a data set. This is not to be confused with a missing data mechanism, which describes possible relationships between data and one’s propensity for missing values. Patterns describe where the gaps in the data are, whereas mechanisms explain why the values are missing.

Data thinking
Want a DS project? There’s health insurance data out there
“
And no (public) resources for working with the data yet
”. A lot has been said about this release of several hundreds of TeraBytes of price data – a great resource, or obfuscation-by-overwhelm? – and
this blog post (https://counting.substack.com/p/want-a-ds-project-theres-health-insurance)has a good set of tech thoughts.

AI
Loab
You might have seen the series of tweets and articles about Loab, the
creepy face that keeps appearing in images produced by an AI model (https://twitter.com/supercomposite/status/1567162288087470081), which also seems to “infect” any image that gets mixed with it.
I found
this visualization (https://twitter.com/jthteo/status/1567418273628655617)by Prof James Teo rather good at understanding conceptually what’s happening: “
Here is an example of a UMAP of a latent space. If there is a cluster apart from the main cluster of pretty art, then a negative prompt from most embeddings in the main cluster will decode to embeddings in the purple cluster.

Something else
Hung up
Song Exploder is one of my favourite non-tech podcasts. In each episode, they pretty much eviscerate a song.
Episode 239 (https://songexploder.net/madonna)interviews Madonna and producer Stuart Price on their famous hit “Hung up”, which I had always considered a blasphemous appropriation of ABBA… but there’s actually quite a lot to it :)quantum of sollazzo
