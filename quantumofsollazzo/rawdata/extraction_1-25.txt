Heya! Service message: from this week’s issue, I’m moving away from Mailchimp and trialling a
new system to send the newsletter
,
Buttondown (https://buttondown.email/). I’m doing that for a variety of reasons, including ballooning costs whereby Buttondown has a gentler pricing ($5 every 1,000 subscribers), but also because almost everyone I know with a free newsletter (e.g.
Duncan (https://buttondown.email/duncangeere)‘s brilliant log) these days swears by Buttondown.
Buttondown is also a one-man company with raving reviews, and I’m very attracted by the concept. My workflow is much faster on it than it was on Mailchimp, so I’m quite positive about it. That said, I’m still getting acquainted with the online editor, so if you see anything amiss or weird, please let me know.
Let me also welcome
Serah Njambi Rono (https://twitter.com/serahrono)as
the newest

A little
data reflection
for you this week comes from
this tweet (https://twitter.com/sTeamTraen/status/1361067408660783115)which reminded me of John Tukey’s seminal (and brilliantly titled) paper “Sunset Salvo” (paywalled
version (http://www.jstor.org/stable/2683137)on JStor). The tweet captures one of its most quoted excerpts:
The data may not contain the answer
. The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.
I keep repeating this as a mantra to anyone who – professionally or leisurly – claims that “the data says” or that “the data shows”. Data don’t have answers. Datasets are a way to, in fact, explore questions. Data is not neutral: using data has got whatever agenda the data user has. The only way to use data properly is to acknowledge that agenda, and be open and transparent about it. This theme was one of the lines I explored in a
recent lecture to the University of Bologna (http://www.puntofisso.net/battistini/)about Data in Public Communications.

Jamie Whyte created this brilliant

COVID in Europe
Francesco Paolo Paolicelli, an Italian data analyst, has created this
at-a-glance comparison (https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xuadD/1/)of COVID cases in Europe, ordered by deaths per million. The data comes from Worldometer, so I’m sure someone here could replicate it with a less controversial data source (
hint
).

Launching the Facebook Map
Cartographic legends Stamen
tell the story (https://hi.stamen.com/launching-the-facebook-map-8d028c4f0e0e)of how they built Facebook’s global, multi-scale base map. They make some interesting points.
You may notice that our map doesn’t include any icons for points of interest, as you might expect from a normal web map. That’s because the map is intended to be a foundation for marker layers that will be placed dynamically based on how the map is being used, whether for recommendations, local search, or any number of future uses. Our base map design with pale colors and no icons allows overlaid social layers that use more saturated colors to come to the foreground.

Why I’ve tracked every single piece of clothing I’ve worn for three years
I love data-obsessed people.
Have you ever wondered whether expensive clothes are worth their price? Or had that subtle feeling of guilt when buying something pricey, and then justifying it because you will wear it so many times, even if you have no clue if it’s actually true? If you thought yes, then
this is for you (https://www.reaktor.com/blog/why-ive-tracked-every-single-piece-of-clothing-ive-worn-for-three-years/).

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Read it in your browser ().
Last week I had my first day off since November, and it was pretty good. I had forgotten the joys of a day of sweet laziness. As many others, I had struggled to think I should take days off without the ability to travel anywhere. As I should have known, it was refreshing and I should probably do this again – just a day off in between working weeks.
·
I keep finding repeat instances of issues around
definitions
. This time, it's in the discussion around COVID tests. I've heard reports that school pupils in the UK will be offered multiple tests in order to make their return to school safer, which is great news. What's less great is the slightly hysterical debate about false positives, alleging that students might be (I quote) "
forced
to self-isolate needlessly". Of course, the issue here is clear: every test comes with a certain share of false positives and false negatives. Generally, those who develop tests will try and minimise one at the expense of the other one. This is normal, expected, and the way tests generally work. The problem is the way public debate addresses the issue, though, suggesting that there's something
wrong
in this as opposed to an ordinary feature of a test.
If this sounds familiar, we've heard similar discussions around the vaccines. A vaccine – any vaccine – protects the recipient to the vaccine up to a certain level because of the way the immune system produces antibodies as a response; but it does also provide an extra level of protection when everyone around you is vaccinated, because the virus will not find a fertile ground for transmission. This means that vaccines that produce a weak immune response but that are widely adopted will massively reduce the number of infections. Once again, the way most of public debate addresses the issue is by not showing the interdependent and independent variables around the process. I've seen some discussions implicitly suggesting that protection is a binary yes/no (when, in fact, the response could vary). I'll never cease to appeal for better, more in-depth discussions around definitions and processes, and I'm really worried to see how superficially the public debate sometimes is.
On a positive note, I liked the NPR immunity simulator, linked below, because I think it captures this problem well.
·
Ofcom rejected, as I thought it would, part of my FOI
request (https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/broadband_checker_information_an)for broadband data. I'm still working on a response. I think that the decision to not release the data in bulk comes from an overly cautious (and, I believe, incorrect) reading of FOIA and of the nature of the data. I think that releasing the data in bulk would be extremely useful to a variety of parties: planners, digital advocates, analysts, researchers, and, ultimately, benefit both Ofcom and the providers. I'll keep you posted if there are any updates.

Major League Baseball’s long-overdue decision to recognize the statistics of players from the Negro Leagues means that MLB’s record book is expanding.

The gender gap in European governments and parliaments
"
While the proportion of women in the executive and legislative bodies of EU countries has grown over the years, access to key positions of political influence is still limited — in some member states
more (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/The-gender-gap-in-European-governments-and-parliaments)than in others.
"
From the European Data Journalism Network, as are the following couple of links – all their articles can be freely redistributed, which is pretty awesome.
The gender pay gap could close in 257 years
The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have made things worse in terms of pay equality.
Moreover (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/index.php/eng/News/Data-news/The-gender-pay-gap-could-close-in-257-years), "
85 countries have had no female leaders in the past 50 years.
Globally, only 55% of women are in the labour market, compared to 78% of men.
72 countries prohibit women to open a bank account or request a loan.
In not a single country do men spend as much time as women in unpaid work.
"
On a similar note, the same applies to
migrants (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/index.php/eng/News/Data-news/The-migrant-pay-gap-is-widening).
COVID-19
What Are the Vaccine Roadblocks Where You Live?
The New York Times
takes a look (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/25/opinion/covid-vaccination-barriers.html)at what is preventing Americans from getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
We learn that "
pinning blame on this misinformation campaign alone ignores dozens of other systemic issues that continue to compromise the American health care system.
"
What will it be like when we go back to the office?
I have to admit this is personally interesting. I actually like the ability to choose to work from home
if
I have an office. Interestingly, a couple of jobs ago I had the option to work from home, but rarely used it (3-4 days per year). This set of game-like
visualizations (https://graphics.reuters.com/GREAT-REBOOT/OFFICE/xlbpgdyjzvq/)by Reuters are giving me a few reflections on what going back might be like.
"
Some people are sick of working from home, but the office they remember is very different from the one they will return to.
"
The point about the end of meetings is interesting: people used to walk out together and probably have more meaningful interaction then than during the meeting; this is now lost.
How Herd Immunity Works — And What Stands In Its Way
"
What will it take to finally halt the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S.? To answer that question, we've created a simulation of a mock disease we're calling SIMVID-19.

#413: quantum of sollazzo – 16 March 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Last week we celebrated Open Data Day 2021. In the last few years, the day has reflected upon the Open Data movement and its achievements, noting that the strong impetus for transparency and machine readable data that characterised the late noughties and early 2010s has been replaced by a somewhat negative vibe.
We have open data portals with thousands of unusable datasets, the data versioning isn’t appropriately managed in 99% of those, and what’s worse is that there are few success stories built around open data. And yet, 2021 is the year in which everyone seems to understand how good, timely, structured, high quality data that is linked to real-life processes can be a matter of life and death. COVID-19 has produced an understanding that data matters more than ever, not through empty words about digital twins, but by offering a real chance of monitoring and informing what’s happening out there in the real world.
Alex Blandford
offers (https://www.notion.so/Open-Data-Day-2021-b4fe1b29e5e5432281c7f56b0c81eff7)a short but spot-on reading on Open Data Day. He writes: “
User needs are a slightly/massively reductive way of viewing the world, but in terms of open data, the “so that” is always missing. Armchair auditors never appeared in the wake of open data release and civil society’s oft repeated call of “holding government to account” rings hollow as there basically isn’t any mechanism to do this. Making yet another website that shows the government is performing like shit is having no impact. So, as a community, we need to articulate what we need data for and how we can use it for purposes that are emancipatory and impactful, rather than just another map.
”
And so I find myself flirting the idea of an upside down government data portal. Let’s start with ordinary problems, and then identify the data that we need, the structure that it needs to have, the frequency of updates, and the governance around it. Doing this by marking the data flows and whether the data exists or not in some form, will enable campaigners to focus on creating solid processes (including by enshrining them in
specific
legislation, if and when required).
Missing Numbers (https://missingnumbers.org)by Anna Powell-Smith has done quite a bit to highlight the data that should be there in order to look at a problem. Do you think there is a fundamental flawed approach in a problem-first view of data publication? I’m curious to hear your views.
Till next week,
Giuseppe

#414: quantum of sollazzo – 23 March 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
This tweet (https://twitter.com/LeoDensian/status/1371889518631137286)from Chris Barnes, one of my favourite data gurus, was pretty spot on. He illustrates the Chief Data Office at his organisation, Highways England, as having to answer 4 questions:
Do we have the data we need?
Is it fit for purpose?
Is it accessible?
Do we create value from the data?
This is pretty much a data strategy – and a good plan for data use – condensed into four lines, which I like a lot.
Doing good things with data need not be complicated. In particular, Information Governance need not be complicated. I once had an infuriating IG experience. My team needed access to a research database which did not contain any personal data. Access was regulated via username and password. The team had to go through a full 80-page-long Data Protection Impact Assessment because “username and passwords are personal data”. Which is… kinda correct, but also kinda wrong.
Things can be less complicated, can’t they?

A few months back, I created a few maps using OpenStreetMap data (shameless plug: there are a handful still available and you can get 20% off using the discount code
NEWSLETTER20 (https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Puntofisso)). Interestingly, this has got me thinking about derived data, licensing, and credits. Using data from OpenStreetMap is relatively unrestricted, and there are some simple credit rules that I thought I followed. However, after a few people asked me about the way I had credited the work to OpenStreetMap, I decided to verify with the OSM Legal Team, just to be sure. And this became an interesting opportunity for reflection on open data projects. This is because what happened next is that it was really hard to speak with anyone on the legal team (
an issue that was featured on the OSM weekly (https://twitter.com/jnicho02/status/1368592191279554561), and after repeated attempts I ended up having a conversation with a few members of the board.
Now, this might seem like a minor and uninteresting story to you, but I’m reflecting on what happens when you build a large and successful open database like OpenStreetMap. Should projects like OSM always have a legal team? On the one hand, I appreciate the burden this creates, organisationally and financially; on the other, wouldn’t it be a good way to both engage with the community (to give the peace of mind to people who want to use the data in good faith) and to protect the project from misuse?

In last week’s issue, we featured a link to the New York Times headline A/B testing analysis. Jeremy Singer-Vine (whose
newsletter Data Is Plural (https://www.data-is-plural.com)I’ll never cease to recommend) pointed out that the data that powers the analysis comes from the
NYT Tracker (https://nyt.tjcx.me), a website that queries the New York Times’ API in order to build data about how articles end up on the front pages. Interesting concept.

The latest issue of the Economist’s
Off the charts (https://www.economist.com/offthecharts/)newsletter was an absolute corker. The lead piece, written by Marie Segger, was  the story of how the team decided to map Cambodia to show the correlation between soil fertility and the bombs dropped 40 years earlier.
It is a really thoughtful insight into the choices that go into making a map that tells a catchy story through complex data, making that data easy to immediately grasp. These were my three key takeaways:
don’t be afraid of extra dimensions
think outside of the box
combine different chart types into one.
None of this is easy to do in a balanced way, of course, and that’s why they are The Economist’s data team :) But it’s truly inspiring that they’re so open about how they conduct their work.
·
Speaking of The Economist, this map has been circulating, showing the massive outlier that was the COVID rate in the city of Bolzano, one of my favourite areas of Italy.
Except… there was no outlier. The data was, in some way, incorrect: there were old cases that had not been added to the counts and the public administration decided to add them all together to the new version of the dataset. I say “in some way” incorrect because for the
use
that the public administration had in mind, the final tally was all that mattered. But this is not how many other users of that same data processed it.
As my friends at
Dataninja (http://www.dataninja.it/)say in their latest newsletter, data are not the best source of information if there is no understanding of how they are created and why.
And so I find myself in two camps: as a
data user
, I must feel the responsibility to always challenge what the data seems to be telling me; but as a
data producer
(with my public servant hat) I also feel a massive responsibility to make sure that the data creation process is clear and well documented.

A Close-Up Picture of Partisan Segregation, Among 180 Million Voters
Racial segregation is notoriously visible in US Census data. This
article (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/17/upshot/partisan-segregation-maps.html)uses the same techniques to look at what it calls “partisan segregation”, i.e. the geographic concentration of people by party political allegiance.
“But keep zooming in — say, to the level of individual addresses for 180 million registered voters — and this pattern keeps repeating itself: within metro areas, within counties and cities, even within parts of the same city.”
P.S. I’m not entirely convinced by the use of the word “segregation” here, with the baggage it carries.

Reprojecting the Perseverance landing footage onto satellite imagery
This (https://matthewearl.github.io/2021/03/06/mars2020-reproject/)is a tad on the hardcore side even for this newsletter’s readers, but it might be useful.
“One thing that I found remarkable was the self-similarity of the martian terrain. As the lander descends towards the ground it is hard to get a sense of scale, since there is no familiar frame of reference to tell us how far away the ground is. This led me to embark on a project in which I reproject the footage onto a satellite image obtained from the Mars Express Orbiter, along with a scale to tell us how large features on the ground actually are.”

#416: quantum of sollazzo – 6 April 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
This
photo (https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1375110505388417025)is going around. It depicts what Google Translate does when asked to translate a text in Hungarian, which is a genderless language in terms of grammar. What’s happening is pretty remarkable: it translates each sentence into English, a language with genders, and assigns them a gender according to what looks like bias. As I’m writing this newsletter, Google Translate
still does it (https://translate.google.com/).
There are several levels of discussions that apply here. “Is Google Translate biased?” is the tip of the iceberg: the algorithm of translation is based on ingesting a lot of examples of translations. So the question becomes, in fact, two questions:
Were those examples
selected
in a biased way?
Where the examples themselves biased to begin with?
The difference is subtle. In the first case, the responsibility lies with the data scientists who selected the examples. But I can also easily imagine a situation in which centuries of texts that
told the stories of men more than they did of women (https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph)can have an impact on how we build translation algorithms today.
It doesn’t end here. If you read the thread, there is also an intriguing suggestion that this might be a piece of poetry, created precisely to elicit a reflection on gender discrimination in speakers of a genderless language. 
I don’t know if that’s true or not, and my knowledge of Hungarian is less than zero, but this possible depiction triggers a question on how we expect an AI-driven translator to deal with the subtlety of such cases, where context is so important that sometimes not even humans can understand it (and for a bit of Internet subculture, read about
Poe’s Law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law)if you’ve never heard about the concept).

We believe in the potential of data journalism in
fostering innovation in newsrooms
and presenting new perspectives on issues that affect citizens and institutions.
The European Data Journalism Network (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/)was born precisely to sustain the growth of data journalism in the European media landscape. We do so by
producing data-driven stories
on a weekly basis, and putting them at the disposal of any media organisation by using an
open license
.
We also promote
data literacy and mutual learning
through tutorials, webinars, and explanations of methodologies and techniques. A series of
original tools (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/Resources-for-Journalists#ancora2)make it easier for journalists to work with data, regardless of their level of acquaintance with them.
We also have a

Long-term death trends
Colin Angus, of ScHARR – Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at University of Sheffield,
tweets (https://twitter.com/VictimOfMaths/status/1376887606789738500)a few speculative ideas on ONS death data, which shows how we’re now in a situation where deaths are actually lower than the long-term average. There are some interesting points in the thread that would deserve some deeper investigation, such as the impact of gender, or the alleged lower rates of flu deaths.
Steer through the Suez Canal
“Navigating the Suez Canal is a high-stress, complicated feat that requires master piloting skills. To demonstrate, we worked with Master Mariner Andy Winbow and Captain Yash Gupta to produce this simulated passage.

As much as it’s non-scientific (and openly so),

this article (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/More-and-more-trains-crossing-European-borders)by Gianluca De Feo and Lorenzo Ferrari for OBC Transeuropa is really close to home.

However, there are still profound differences between the central and peripheral regions of Europe.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Ah,
this tweet by Will Geary (https://twitter.com/wgeary/status/1379573724882599941). Wars were started over much less. Does nobody really use dashboards? Or is it, maybe, that most dashboards are unusable and badly designed? 
There are a few interesting reflections both in the thread by Will and in the many replies to it and my
quote-tweet (https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/1379720086932627456)of it.
Two concepts seem to emerge: first, that the only useful dashboards are those that tell you at a glance if something has gone
wrong
, as opposed to those that promise
deeper insight about problem X
; second, that dashboards can be meta: the due diligence required to build them will tell you if you have the right data infrastructure in place or if you’ve got work to do. Where do you stand?

Interesting post by Facebook’s Nick Clegg
here (https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2)on the role of his employer in keeping user behaviours in check. Needless to say, Clegg argues that Facebook is not to blame for users misbehaviour, specifically arguing that “the algorithm” just highlights existing thoughts and opinions. As much as that is true, as an AI practitioner I disagree strongly.
When using Artificial Intelligence, we must all reflect on our own responsibility. To put it simply, highlighting a behaviour comes with a very high risk of encouraging it: “the algorithm” influences behaviours by making the rare seem ordinary. I believe it is our role as AI practitioners to make sure we don’t lose track of this.

An interesting free workshop is happening on the 27/4, run by GIS guru Prof Maria Antonia Brovelli of Milan Polytechnic:
Satellite Data Analysis and Machine Learning Classification with QGIS, part 1 (https://aiforgood.itu.int/events/workshop-satellite-data-analysis-and-machine-learning-classification-with-qgis-part-1/). Part 2 will be on 11/5. The workshop
“introduces how classification of satellite imagery can be done with QGIS by showing how to retrieve, process and classify satellite imagery, as well as how to assess performance of machine learning algorithms through error matrix and accuracy indexes.”

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)sponsored content from EDJNet
At the European Data Journalism Network we’ve been producing a dozen articles per month since 2017, covering plenty of issues affecting European citizens.
We’ve been paying much attention to social issues, with a special focus on health matters (from
mental health (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Large-investigation/Pay-up-or-put-it-off-how-Europe-treats-depression-and-anxiety)to the
causes of death (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Homicide-and-suicide-rates-in-the-EU-are-falling)) and on individuals and communities living
at the margins (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/The-uncountable-How-Covid-19-affected-migrants-and-refugees-health), i.e. people exposed to poverty, poor infrastructures and little opportunities.
The climate crisis was the focus of some of our most ambitious investigations to date: we’ve explored the
impact of global warming (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/An-interactive-map-on-climate-warming-in-Europe)in Europe, as well as the main sources of
carbon emissions (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Emissions-in-Europe-how-much-CO2-does-energy-cost-us).
The state of democracy in Europe is another of our main concerns, leading to the coverage of
infringements of EU law (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/Tools-for-journalists/InfringEye), threats to
digital rights (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/tags/view/Website+Tags/Digital+rights), and the influence of
big tech companies (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Big-Tech-s-aggressive-EU-lobbying-has-caused-a-power-shift).
We also have a
weekly newsletter (https://europeandatajournalism.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe).
Topical
Following the Science
“A look at the global research effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.”
This (https://pudding.cool/2021/03/covid-science/)is one of those brilliant interactive uses of scrollytelling by The Pudding.
See How Rich Countries Got to the Front of the Vaccine Line
The New York times
illustrates (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/31/world/global-vaccine-supply-inequity.html)global inequalities in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
China’s Covid Rebound Edges It Closer to Overtaking U.S. Economy
“Since the 1970s, China has been racing to become the world’s largest economy. Its recovery from the pandemic means it could eclipse the U.S. this decade.”
I link to
this article (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-china-accelerated-growth/)fundamentally for a single reason: the racetrack visualization.
Predicting FT Trending Topics
Adam Gajtkowski of the Financial Times
shows (https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/predicting-ft-trending-topics-7eda85ece727)how the team used time-series analysis and unsupervised machine learning to identify signals and, allegedly, “
help journalists write more relevant stories
”.
A People Map of the US
“
…where city names are
replaced (https://pudding.cool/2019/05/people-map/)by their most Wikipedia’ed resident: people born in, lived in, or connected to a place.
”
Methodology notes: data collected using the Wikipedia API and using the “People from X city” pages on Wikipedia.
The top person from each city was determined by using median pageviews (with a minimum of 1 year of traffic).
Data v Science
“Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work”: Data Cascades in High-Stakes AI
ACADEMIC PAPER KLAXON.
“In this paper, we report on data practices
in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India,
East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and
present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events
causing negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered
by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality.

The ghosts in the data
Related to and citing the paper above is this brilliant
blog post (http://veekaybee.github.io/2021/03/26/data-ghosts/)by Vicki Boykis.
The basic block of labor of machine learning is cleaning data and setting up engineering pipelines, the detailed and tedious work of making all the pieces fit together. However, there is no way you can learn this.
Building a Data Platform in 2021
“How to build a modern, scalable data platform to power your analytics and data science projects.”
This is a good
blog post (https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-data-platform-in-2021-b759f6470426)articulating several aspects of building a data science platform through the steps of data integration, building a data warehouse, transformation, presentation, and transportation.
(via Guy Lipman)Alternatives to a Log Scale
Yet another (https://stephanieevergreen.com/alternatives-to-a-log-scale/)take on the use of log scale (which the pandemic has turned into the pie charts of these years), advocating the use of callout boxes.
Data scientists are predicting sports injuries with an algorithm
“
Machine learning can tell athletes when to train and when to stop. (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00818-1)“
You’re probably measuring your treatment effect incorrectly
“You’ve developed a new health program and you want to measure its impact. You run a randomized experiment where half of participants are allowed to get treatment, and half are not. Of those allowed to get treatment, 80% actually choose to get treated.
You would like to report the answer to a very basic question: How much did the treatment help the people who got treated? You might think that’s a simple question to answer. But you’d be wrong.”
Useful
resource (https://chris-said.io/2021/03/28/youre-measuring-wrong/)for journalists reporting about vaccines and therapies.

How to vectorise the Environment Agency’s Reservoir Flood Map Outline data
If you’re interested in using the Environment Agency’s Risk of Flooding from Reservoir outline maps, or fancy a challenge in learning a GIS workflow,
this blog post (https://www.owenboswarva.com/blog/post-ea4.htm)by Owen Boswarva explains “

“
Elevation Scan
This (https://observablehq.com/@neocartocnrs/elevation)is a pretty and quirky idea. How to create a “scan-like” animation that shows geographical data variance over a map. It uses D3.
Dimension reduction 1
A step-by-step
tutorial (https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/slides/dimension-reduction-1.html)in Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a technique that allows you to reduce the dimensions of a multidimensional vector and, as a consequence, to

SQLite is not a toy database
“Whether you are a developer, data analyst, QA engineer, DevOps person, or product manager -
SQLite is a perfect tool for you (https://antonz.org/sqlite-is-not-a-toy-database/).”

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Commenting on last week’s issue’s debate on how users of AI on social media platforms need to be careful about their own responsibility in shaping user behaviours, my friend Luis, a reader of this newsletter, sent me this excerpt: “
Social Media evolved from an information platform to an affirmation platform
”. This is a pretty good description of what social media has become, and why we need to be very careful in using AI in this context.
Speaking of context, I read this brilliant
piece (https://warzel.substack.com/p/its-not-cancel-culture-its-a-platform)by Charlie Warzel on what happened to journalist Elle Hunt when she posted an admittedly half-serious opinion about films, which was tweeted in a mixture of faux-outrage and humour, was picked up by Twitter’s “trending” algorithm, and ended up as the object of (very real) abuse. Charlie describes it as “context collapse”, and this is a definition I really like as I think it applies to the very similar phenomenon that happens when data is quoted without its accompanying context – something that Twitter has a lot to answer for given its reduced text length.

Many journalists fascinated by data journalism have struggled with entry barriers and complex tools for data analyses and visualizations. In order to lower barriers and foster data journalism, the European Data Journalism Network has been developing
some tools (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/Resources-for-Journalists)that can make journalists' life easier.
For instance, the
Stats Monitor (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/Tools-for-journalists/Stats-Monitor)offers ready-made dataviz and newsleads based on the latest data by Eurostat and other sources, highlighting trends and outliers. The
Quote Finder (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/Tools-for-journalists/Quote-Finder)comes handy if you want to explore the EU debate, including MEPs' activity on Twitter or the official statements by EU institutions.
We have also been listing
data sources (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/Tools-for-journalists/Useful-data)that can be useful for journalists, dividing them by themes.
We also have a
weekly newsletter (https://europeandatajournalism.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe).

Data Acquisition for Beginners
Part of the “The Kit” by Exposing the Invisible,
this (https://kit.exposingtheinvisible.org/en/how/data-acquisition.html)is a great introduction to the topic of data acquisition. Ideally, read the whole kit.
Exploring other {GGPLOT2} geoms
If you use ggplot2, a popular data visualization library for the R programming language,
this tutorial (https://ivelasq.rbind.io/blog/other-geoms)offers a good set of reusable examples into how to create streamgraphs, ridgeline plots, Sankey diagrams, bump charts, waffles charts, beeswarm charts, and mosaic charts.
Google Earth is now a 3D time machine
“
Google
puts (https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/google-earth-is-now-a-3d-time-machine/)20 petabytes of historical satellite data into the Google Earth globe
”, ArsTechnica reports.
Of course, not all of the planet has equal amounts of data and, most importantly, it isn’t entirely obvious to me if it gets updated and with what frequency (maybe it’s just me being unable to Google for it…), but if it’s got to this point, it might get better: “
With Timelapse open, you’ll get a big panel on the right side with a timeline from 1984 to today, and a few shortcuts to places Google says are particularly interesting. Google Earth Timelapse doesn’t work well across the entire world just yet. Some places, like New York City, appear hopelessly blurry, even when you set the timer to 2020. Google’s highlighted locations, like Dubai, look a lot better and play out like a game of SimCity.

handy set of of techniques (http://pythonspeed.com/memory/)to process larger-than-RAM datasets in Python by operating on code structure, using data management strategies, measuring memory usage, and adopting advanced techniques in Pandas and NumPy.
Writing tools I learned from The Economist
“I like the writing style of The Economist for many reasons: the most important is that it’s easy to understand their point. […] These are 6 writing tools I learned from The Economist. As you’ll see, they exist to serve, not confuse, the reader.”
Ok,
this article (https://builtbywords.substack.com/p/writing-tools-i-learned-from-the)is not about data but about writing style. Still, if you’re writing about data, you should follow the same set of rules. (Also, I didn’t know that The Economist calls itself a newspaper rather than a magazine.)AI

Reduced content this week as I’ve taken a few days off work to travel a little. We could only do what’s allowed, which meant going by car to the New Forest for a self-catered accommodation and plenty of walks in the nature. This would have probably been a “minor long weekend” before the pandemic, but it now has the feel of a major holiday.

How historic vaccination research paved the way for the COVID-19 vaccine
Datawrapper’s
weekly chart (https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/weekly-charts/)really puts vaccines into perspective. As Mirko Lorentz asks,
“do we appreciate enough that we are witnessing the fastest development of finding and producing vaccines in history, by far?”
There’s also an interesting look at some diseases for which a vaccine hasn’t been yet found.
In their own words: How different people respond to coronavirus guidance
“The government’s coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance has restricted day-to-day life to reduce the spread of infection. In interviews and diaries, people from different social groups
describe (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/intheirownwordshowdifferentpeoplerespondtocoronavirusguidance/2021-04-12)in their own words what influenced them to follow – or not follow – the guidance.”
Fascinating findings.
(via Soph Warnes’s
Fair Warning (https://www.getrevue.co/profile/FairWarning))Redlined, Now Flooding
Redlining was the practice, sadly legal and common since the 1930, to systematically denying services, by either the government or private company, through the selective raising of prices. This practice affected particularly – as you can imagine – the black community in the US. Now, Bloomberg
finds (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-flood-risk-redlining/)that
neighborhoods that suffered redlining in the 1930s face a far higher risk of flooding today.”
Voters Say Those on the Other Side ‘Don’t Get’ Them. Here’s What They Want Them To Know
“There is a sentiment with which large shares of both Biden and Trump voters agree: a feeling that those who supported the other candidate have little or no understanding of people like them.”
This (https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/)is an excellent piece of research by the Pew Research Centre.  When you start reading the actual comments, though, it gets a tad depressing.

When real world mapping meets Tolkien
Have you ever wondered how to make a hand-drawn Middle Earth-looking map of… areas in the UK?

Where every plastic ever made ended up
Although there are quite a few caveats to the topic of
this data visualization (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mpm6w0/oc_where_every_plastic_ever_made_ended_up/)(read the full reddit to understand), I think it’s a pretty brilliant idea.  The dataviz originally comes from
this article (https://www.dataetc.org/2021/04/10/plastic.html), although the code still doesn’t appear on their
GitHub account (https://github.com/dataetc/Data-Et-cetera).
WorldWideMap
“The
WorldWideMap timeline (http://infomesh.org/worldwidemap)shows how the internet has spread in different countries through time. With the help of a dynamic cartogram (a map where the scale of each region has been proportionally modified) we are able to lose the connection with the real geographical space and perceive the cyberspace instead. In this way the connected people of each country clearly show their presence on the world wide web.”
It uses WorldBank data.
Why your state might lose or gain clout in Congress after the census is released
“
Rhode Island is likely to draw the short straw in the once-a-decade reshuffling of U.S. House seats

One of those interesting
looks (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/how-apportionment-works/)at how oddly the US electoral system is designed. And, well, the dataviz here is odd, too.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, new readers. Quite a few of you have subscribed in the past couple of weeks, so welcome – if you've joined for the data stuff, you'll probably stay for the geeky links too.
So, let me start with a service announcement about the launch of a "
Six questions with...
", a new section of Quantum of Sollazzo with a set of brief interviews with great people who work with data. I have some true stars lined up, starting today with the Wall Street Journal's Soph Warnes.
·
If you speak Italian and want to hear yours truly blabbering in Italian about Open Data, I will join DataNinja on their
live session this Wednesday, May 6th
, alongside Giorgia Lodi and Maurizio Napolitano, two leaders of the Open Data movement in Italy. We'll be comparing notes about the state of Open Data in Italy and the UK.
Join
on Youtube (https://youtu.be/KcaIn_9EgLQ)at 6pm Rome time/5pm London time.
Trivia: I first met Giorgia when she taught me at university (in a galaxy far far away), while my first meeting with Maurizio involved a beer garden in Berlin (we where there for WhereCamp EU).

The UK Open Government Network is launching thematic groups in order to allow civil society and civil servants to meet and discuss specific policy themes for the UK's next Open Government National Action Plan, to be published later this year.
"Over the next couple of months, Thematic Groups will bring together civil servants and civil society to discuss and co-create proposals around these different topics.
Your participation will help shape government policy pledges. With stories about transparency at the highest levels of government dominating the news, this has never been more important."

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to... Soph Warnes
Soph Warnes, Strategy Editor, WSJ tweets at @SophieWarnes. She also authors
Fair Warning (https://www.getrevue.co/profile/FairWarning), a pretty good data newsletter (with a pretty good pun as its title).
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I used to do a lot more data journalism type work, but now I work more with analytics data. I use BigQuery (and thus SQL), Data Studio, Google Sheets, Excel. I miss using R a lot, and even Python. I just don't have good excuses to use them anymore, everything has a GUI now.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I am inordinately proud of
Which occupations are at the highest risk of being automated? (https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichoccupationsareathighestriskofbeingautomated/2019-03-25)which I worked on while I was at ONS. It was a difficult project — I had to persuade everyone to go with my vision and keep everyone's nerves steady when people wanted to kill it off. It's the civil service: they don't do cool things. But I was so pleased with the end result. The statisticians came to me and said "hey we think this might appeal to a broader audience" and my colleague and I had been looking for an excuse to create an editorial chatbot. The idea of having a bot explain automation to people really tickled me. It was just perfect. It was really successful for us. I ended up going to Paris and talking about chatbots at the OECD. Automation risk was discussed in Parliament in the UK and I'm so sure it's because of this crazy unexpected thing that got a lot of attention. People were like "The ONS did this!?". We won awards for it. It's just so cool and satisfying that it had such a wide impact.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
My favourite fun thing of all time is probably the
Wall Street Journal's explanation of Hamilton (http://graphics.wsj.com/hamilton/)and how rapping and rhyming works. It just gets to the heart of why the musical is so incredibly smart, and for me it nailed why I found the songs so compelling. For a few months it felt like when I listened to the OST, I would hear something new and think, "God, that's so clever". Each rhyme, every pacing change, is very specific and deliberate. It's just such a great explanation and it helped me appreciate Lin Manuel Miranda's writing so much more. And it also comes from such an unexpected place.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Jeremy Singer-Vine. He writes a whole newsletter about them and everything.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
OK so I am chronically disorganised except when it comes to data projects that I do on my laptop because I have a very specific file and folder structure that I rigidly stick to. See also: commenting. I thought comments were for losers. Until I went back to a project years later and was like... "I DID THIS!?!" I comment the hell out of everything now, even small things. And to this end I would also say saving basic 'snippets' of code that perform a specific function saved somewhere will help you so, so much.
Uh, that's three things:
- Comment
- Create and stick to a file/folder structure
- Save reusable snippets in one file
Data is or data are...
Strictly speaking, Data Are. But language evolves over time, and we all need to accept that we are on the Data Is train whether we like it or not.

How Big Tech got so big: Hundreds of acquisitions
"
Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google — known as the Big 4 — now dominate many facets of our lives. But they didn’t get there alone. They
acquired hundreds of companies over decades (https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2021/amazon-apple-facebook-google-acquisitions/)to propel them to become some of the most powerful tech behemoths in the world.

SQLite the only database you will ever need in most cases
We covered this topic previously: in many quarters, SQLite is being hailed as a more "enterprise" solution than we commonly thought, to the point where it's being used as the backend of high performance web services (assuming you can do without a client-server approach, i.e. no replication etc).
Is it crazy?
This article (https://unixsheikh.com/articles/sqlite-the-only-database-you-will-ever-need-in-most-cases.html)argues that no, it's not: "
I have run SQLite as a web application database with thousands concurrent writes every second, coming from different HTTP requests, without any delays or issues. This is because even on a very busy site, the hardware is extremely fast and fully capable of handling that.

Introducing Scale-a-Tron
Whether it's putting containers on a map, or checking the true relative size of continents, scaling things right on a map is tricky, due to the different projections used.
Scale-a-Tron (https://stamen.github.io/scale-a-tron/)is a tool by cartographic experts Stamen that allows you to draw a polygon on a map, and then carry it around by scaling it right. A
blog post (https://hi.stamen.com/introducing-scale-a-tron-91081062e2d0)explains it all.

Data thinking
Data communities need to come before data catalogues
Interesting
piece (https://guylipman.medium.com/data-communities-need-to-come-before-data-catalogues-e55e8314814a)about energy data, which could just as well apply to a different context. Guy Lipman argues that data catalogues are doomed because they can't meet all data needs, and suggests, as an alternative, the development of living platforms to enable shared documentation and enriched data. These are not without risks or issues, but it is interesting to see community building placed centre stage in a data context.
Run Your Data Team Like A Product Team
An interesting take on the
data as a service vs data as a product (https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/run-your-data-team-like-a-product-team/)models (my 2p: I'm never too sure things can work if you go 100% one way or another, without an iterative mindset).
I've found the root cause of the problem in what3words
This
Twitter thread (https://twitter.com/cybergibbons/status/1387164507705860097)has been circulating, alleging that there is an intrinsic issue in the way what3words geocodes locations, as described in their patent. I only managed to follow it up to a point, but the geonerds among you might find it stimulating.

#421: quantum of sollazzo – 11 May 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
One for you Italian speakers (I know who you are): last week, I took part in a great
live conversation on Open Data
, comparing the Italian situation with that of the UK and the rest of the world. Organised by DataNinja and moderated by Donata Columbro, this event was also a great opportunity for me to reconnect with two contacts from my past life who happen to be Open Data legends: Giorgia Lodi, who was one of my university lecturers, and Maurizio Napolitano, who’s responsible for getting me to draw maps with OpenStreetMap. You can find a recording
here (https://www.youtube.com/watch). Note the Brazilian-footballer-like name.

The
Data4Good Festival

Dan Hon, in his
excellent newsletter (https://newsletter.danhon.com/archive/s09e21-seeing-past-the-horizon/), writes a rather in-depth analysis of the Post Office scandal.
For those of you who don’t live in the UK, this is a rather sad story of Post Office employees being convicted and spending years in jail for a crime they had not committed: stealing money. The issue? There was no crime. The IT system that run the transactions had a bug; management had failed to take the bug into account.
This story is interesting because it challenges our reliance on technology, first and foremost, especially in a context in which technology was politically charged. In an age where we’re increasingly relying on algorithms and AI, it gives us a few directions of enquiry: how much of our decision processes should we be giving away to machines? How much should we rely on them? How do we challenge the decisions they take or back? And what is the route to redress if something doesn’t work?
For longer form thinking about similar topics to those of this newsletter, Dan’s newsletter is strongly recommended.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Jeremy Singer-Vine (https://www.jsvine.com/). Jeremy is Data Editor at BuzzFeed News and a fellow newsletter-er of Data Is Plural.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My work typically involves some combination of data gathering, restructuring, cleaning, exploration, and analysis. I have two main workflows. For simple tasks and preliminary exploration, I'm typically using
VisiData (https://www.visidata.org/),
xsv (https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv),
curl (https://curl.se/),
grep (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep),
vim (https://www.vim.org/), and other command-line tools. For more complex tasks and work intended for publication, I'm using
Python (https://www.python.org/)and
Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/), with
pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/),
matplotilb (https://matplotlib.org/),
seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/),
scipy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html),
lxml (https://lxml.de/),
pdfplumber (https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber), and other Python libraries. Ultimately, I'm aiming for a workflow that's as
reproducible (https://source.opennews.org/articles/what-weve-learned-about-sharing-our-data-analysis/)as possible (a habit I find
Makefiles (https://bost.ocks.org/mike/make/)handy for reinforcing), ideally version-controlled in
git (https://git-scm.com/), with
diff (https://dev.to/jennieji/how-to-read-a-raw-git-diff-1pl2)-friendly outputs.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I was only one of several
data-conductors (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jsvine/fincen-files-explainer-data-money-transactions)in the
FinCEN Files (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/fincen-files)orchestra (https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/)(to slightly mangle a metaphor), and that's a big reason why I'm so proud of the project. Collaborating with ICIJ's data team (and the 100+ partner organizations) was invigorating and a real joy, and helped take the investigation to places that would have been impossible otherwise.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
This multidisciplinary, harrowing investigation (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-new-internment-camps-xinjiang-uighurs-muslims), which used
theabsenceof data (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/satellite-images-investigation-xinjiang-detention-camps)(in the form of blank map tiles), architectural expertise, and extensive interviews to examine the growth of Xinjiang's prisons and internment camps.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
... a specific way of seeing, interpreting, organizing, and (inevitably, for better or worse) compressing the world.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Tip: Embrace reproducibility. It might seem like a distraction or time-sink at first, but it pays enormous dividends. It took me a few years to appreciate the value of reproducible workflows, but now I can't imagine doing this work any other way.
Data is or data are...
Philosophically: _are_. Grammatically: _you do you_. Statistico-historically:
kinda fascinating (https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph).

The U.S. Will Need a Lot of Land for a Zero-Carbon Economy
“The goal will require sweeping changes in the power generation, transportation and manufacturing sectors. It will also require a
tremendous amount of land (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-energy-land-use-economy/).”
The US doesn’t lack land, of course, but it’s an interesting question in terms of politics and economic that doesn’t necessarily meets the current consensus in the US. It will be interesting to see how it develops – if it does at all.
Antidepressant use in Europe continues to break records
There are quite a few interesting points in this
article (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Antidepressant-use-in-Europe-continues-to-break-records)shared via the European Data Journalism Network. Two that caught my attention: first, that the use of anti-anxiety medication is stable, while that of antidepressants has gone up considerably; secondly, that Denmark seems to be the only country – among those for which data is available – for which the use of antidepressants has decreased in the time frame considered.
Tools & Tutorials
Practical SQL for Data Analysis – What you can do without Pandas

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Debora Aru (https://twitter.com/Deb_Aru), Data Journalist at Reach
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My work is normally spread over the week and I write stories for our local titles across the UK. Normally I pitch a story on the Friday for next the week. On the following Monday, I start collecting and cleaning the data I want to use for my story, and I interview experts on the topic, who can explain data and trends. I then write the story using local figures for every area that requested a version of it.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
We set up and run a
Covid-19 vaccine calculator (https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/covid-19-vaccine-calculator-works-23421258)that tells people when they're likely to be invited to vaccination. It has been updated following the latest vaccination priority list released by the government, who promise to have the entire adult population vaccinated by the end of July. These dates are estimates based on Office for National Statistics population figures for mid-2019, and the latest seven-day average for the number of people vaccinated.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
It's
How well do you really know your country? (https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/dec/02/how-well-do-you-really-know-your-country-take-our-quiz), a quiz by Alberto Nardelli and others at the Guardian. It shows well how people are ignorant about topical issues in their own country.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Pain. Jokes apart, I think of tables to sort out and look up with local areas I want to analyse.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Learn a programming language. RStudio or Python, for instance. Will make thing much easier and will help with more complex data analysis.
Data is or data are...
"Data is plural."

a new open-source JavaScript library for exploratory data visualization (https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introducing-observable-plot), developed by the authors of D3 (of which it’s not a replacement.)Isochrones
Wikipedia describes isochrones as “
a map that depicts the area accessible from a point within a certain time threshold.
”. You’ve probably seen one before. I’ve recently come across two tools that allow you to create an isochrone. One is
iso4app (http://iso4app.net), while the other is simply a
feature of OpenRouteService (https://maps.openrouteservice.org/). Both are based on OpenStreetMap.
Clustergam: visualisation of cluster analysis
Martin Fleischmann, a researcher in urban morphology and geographic data science at the University of Liverpool,
introduces a Python library to create clustergrams (https://martinfleischmann.net/clustergam-visualisation-of-cluster-analysis/), which are two-dimensional plots capturing the flows of observations between clustering classes as you add more clusters. Yeah, it’s a little mind-bending, but once you see it you’ll get it.
Dataviz
Lighthouse Map
Just a brilliant
map (https://geodienst.github.io/lighthousemap/)of lighthouses, in real colours, by the talented folks at Geodienst. 
As the
open source release README file (https://github.com/geodienst/lighthousemap)says, it takes the data from the “blinking beacon” feature of OpenStreetMap (who knew it existed, and if you want to geek out on how much data there is on lighthouse features, head
here (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/Lights)).
Long Tiny Loop
This was a utterly geeky but fascinating surprise at the last
Geomob (http://thegeomob.com/)meetup (you can see a video
here (https://www.youtube.com/watch)).
“
Long Tiny Loop (https://longtinyloop.com)is a fitness challenge […]. Your goal is to traverse the longest possible non-self-intersecting loop within the smallest possible region, without revisiting any streets or intersections.
“
It’s pretty interesting because of the amount of geometrical formulas involved to make the calculations of the leaderboard (i.e. the “difficulty” of each loop).
Why nobody knows how to pronounce my name in Japanese
“
A writing system with three scripts & thousands of kanji characters
”, as
told (https://blog.datawrapper.de/kanji/)by Datawrapper’s Aya Tanikawa.
The best bit, though, is realising that Murakami’s 1Q84 includes, in the original Japanese version, a piece written only with hiragana and katakana characters and skipping Kanji, because this somehow “simulates” dyslexia. Absolutely mind-bending for someone only used to alphabetic script systems.
We speak about Asian Americans as a single block. Here’s how incredibly complex they are
Well, it’s a bit like discovering hot water, but I guess this is probably unknown by many in the US context. The
article (https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/06/us/demographics-asian-americans-diversity/index.html)presents some interesting data visualizations.
Interactive
Shipmap
Great
interactive dataviz (https://www.shipmap.org/)by the folks at Kiln, using data from UCL. On the map, “
you can see movements of the global merchant fleet over the course of 2012, overlaid on a bathymetric map. You can also see a few statistics such as a counter for emitted CO2 (in thousand tonnes) and maximum freight carried by represented vessels (varying units).
” 
But you can also simply hit play and here the story, with the added pleasure of Goldberg Variations in the background.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hi folks, I hope things are going well wherever you are, especially if you are in countries still badly affected by the pandemic. We’re starting to see the end of the tunnel here in the UK. Personally, I was vaccinated a couple of weeks ago, and – as I start writing this issue – I’ve just come back from my first visit to the barber in over a year.
I cannot help but segue into this good little article by Financial Times’s journalist Tim Harford,
Why bad times call for good data (https://timharford.com/2021/05/why-bad-times-call-for-good-data/), which dispenses very good wisdom: “
Hindsight is a wonderful thing, of course: the next crisis will no doubt demand timely information about something new. But statistical infrastructure can be built to adapt.

Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Gavin Freeguard (twitter.com/GavinFreeguard), freelance consultant, Gavin Freeguard Ltd. Also associate at the Institute for Government, consultant at the Ada Lovelace Institute, and special adviser at the Open Data Institute.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
Historically, I’ve worked with all sorts of government data – usually stitching together spreadsheets from the Office for National Statistics and various government departments. I’ve worked almost exclusively in Excel – better for dataviz than many think and particularly useful for helping an organisation of mainly qualitative researchers to start thinking about and using data. I then use Daniel’s XL Toolbox – a plugin – to produce an emf version of our charts, and export to Inkscape for some editing, and adding titles and source. That file gives us PNGs for web and social media, and designers what they need to produce printed reports.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Whitehall Monitor (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-work/whitehall-monitor), in general - helping people inside and outside government understand what government looks like, how it's changed and how it's performing. As part of that, our analysis of reshuffles and
ministerial resignations (https://twitter.com/GavinFreeguard/status/1384484606649323525)giving a more data-informed view - the former sometimes helped change the narrative (
in 2018 (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/cabinet-reshuffle-live-blog-january-2018), from 'nothing has changed' to 'actually, a lot has changed in important areas of government policy'), the latter showing why
making the data more widely available (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18lagjXjvGjQcv7ZlTnPXNghmrlzvYz7xQuUjUbyEBhM/edit)is worth doing, as lots of others (including news outlets) could use it. Also our work looking at how government measures its own performance (I can't believe we put
this (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/whitehall-monitor-deep-impact)together in about three weeks!).
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
So many things by the data teams at the FT, The Economist, The Pudding, the New York Times or the Washington Post! (With lots of honourable mentions for The Guardian, Reuters, Bloomberg, FiveThirtyEight and others.) A topical one - Transparency International UK's work in making data about
who ministers are meeting (https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/)much more useable, a great example of how we could make government data more accessible and useful.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Pain. But also the pleasure that comes solving problems and finding interesting things.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Here's
some I made earlier (https://smartthinking.org.uk/article/how-to-do-data-visualisation).
Data is or data are...
Data is. I'm told it was one of my tweets that prompted
this poll (https://yougov.co.uk/topics/education/survey-results/daily/2020/07/14/00512/2). And even though I could wax lyrical for ages on why treating data as singular is a real problem!

Data Capitalism
A
report (https://datacapitalism.d4bl.org/)by the Data for Black Lives organization. Needless to say, this is not an impartial report, and its controversial angle that will generate a lot of debate. But it rightly points to a number of intriguing data issues that do a good job of defining this era of intense data exploitation and scrutiny.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello folks, quite a bit happening in my work life, including 3 fantastic new starters this week and, hopefully, our first team pic-nic. Really excited about the all-star team I’m building, including data techies, scientists, and community builders. Quite a bit of work ahead!

This week’s data hero interview is with FiveThirtyEight’s Anna Wiederkehr. I’ve been following her steps since she worked at the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, and she’s been thoroughly impressive over the years, so I’m really pleased she agreed to be interviewed. I hope you enjoy it!

And last,
here’s the latest edition of my ‘slow weeknotes’ (https://weeknot.es/notes-2021-episode-5-f540d40c6fc9), if you’re curious to know what I’ve been up to in May.
‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Anna Wiederkehr (https://twitter.com/wiederkehra), Senior Visual Journalist at FiveThirtyEight.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
What's open on my computer at the moment is a pretty accurate representation: Sketch, Illustrator, R, Atom (code editor with some HTML/CSS/JS beep bops), Microsoft Excel, Notion and a browser open with roughly 40 tabs including Google Sheets, Google Docs and Github. I used to live in a more isolated design world, but in data journalism, there seems to be less phases where you _only_ need design tools or _only_ dev tools.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I'm still stoked on this explainer piece on wildfires in Switzerland I did when I ran the graphics team at the Neue Zürcher Zeitung,
Waldbrände – das flackernde Desaster (https://www.nzz.ch/wissenschaft/waldbraende-erklaert-in-der-schweiz-und-in-europa-ld.1483688)(
here in English (https://medium.com/@wiederkehr.ac/a-flickering-disaster-d78b3635d0f0)and here
a Twitter thread on the process (https://twitter.com/wiederkehra/status/1158687984897732608)). I co-wrote with a great science journalist, Sven Titz and worked closely with two researchers from the
Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (https://www.wsl.ch/en/index.html). I learned so much about geography, mapping and honestly,
the earth
, in working with and visualizing
National Forest Inventory (https://www.lfi.ch/index-en.php)and
SwissFire (https://www.swissfire.ch/)data. I've published arguably "greater" work depending on how you measure greatness, but successful collaborations outside of my industry are what I'm consistently more proud of than anything else.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I'll never forget seeing
this piece (https://multimedia.scmp.com/news/world/article/3000839/permafrost/)for the first time from
Marco Hernandez (https://twitter.com/tmarcoh)and
Pablo Robles (https://twitter.com/pabloroblesg)with the egg-shaped world showing earth's surface temperature – I'm routinely in awe of  the unique visual storytelling from South China Morning Post and how they manage such density in their visualization combined with an approachable style.
Otherwise I am jealous of/would love the opportunity to work on anything with
Joshua Stevens (https://twitter.com/jscarto)from NASA,
Tim Wallace (https://twitter.com/wallacetim)from NYT, along with
Mira Rojanasakul (https://twitter.com/rjnskl)and
Jeremy C.F. Lin (https://twitter.com/Jeremy_CF_Lin)from Bloomberg. I'm sending all of them virtual heart-eyes.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
I think "god I hope this isn't only available as a PDF."
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
I fiercely endorse
Soph Warne's (https://twitter.com/SophieWarnes)tip to comment the hell out of everything. If anyone looks at any code I write, you'll see more comments than actual functioning code.
In a similar vein,
versioning
is critical to iterative design work. So if you have the luxury of time when experimenting with visualization on a project, save versions (i.e. different files) of your work. This is great for organization, the ability to resurface a past idea that might be better, the exploration of many concepts, and documentation. Plus you can
share it (https://annawiederkehr.com/Process)so others can learn from your work too!

Most common professional marriages

this San Francisco Chronicle article (https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/These-are-the-most-common-professional-marriages-16180115.php), which, of course, finds that the stats are slightly skewed towards software developers marrying developers… you know, it’s the Bay Area.
Shifting songs of Eurovision
Yeah, Italy won, stop reminding me of that. You know, I’m a big fan of the previous Italian winner (mainly because a lifetime ago it got me a
2-page spread (https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news/italy-brexit-insieme-guisseppe-sollazzo-25960)on a printed British newspaper).
But Eurovision inspired, as usual, quite a bit of dataviz. Among others, Reuters Graphics published
this wholesome explainer (https://graphics.reuters.com/MUSIC-EUROVISION/FINAL/rlgvdyeqzpo/index.html)(extra points if you recognise the pretty obvious outlier in the picture), while
this page by EurovisionWorld.com (https://eurovisionworld.com/eurovision/2021)is a mine of data about the competition.
(via Ian Chaplin)What does global warming spell for you… and your loved ones?
Isabella Chua at Kontinentalist, a storytelling outlet based in Singapore,
takes (https://kontinentalist.com/stories/how-do-boomers-millennials-and-gen-z-feel-global-warming-differently)a pretty peculiar approach to analysing climate change: she shows how different generations in Asia have witnessed or are witnessing changing average temperatures.
“
To put things into perspective, we plot how average temperatures will change in each generation’s lifetime. The charts begin with the earliest birth year of each generation: 1946, 1965, 1981, and 1997, for Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z, respectively.
“
The Pandemic Has Split in Two
“
Zero deaths in some cities. Thousands in others. The pandemic’s fault lines continue to widen as vaccines flow toward rich countries.
“
The New York times
reports (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/15/world/covid-inequality-vaccines.html)on vaccine inequality (while also showing how cities in South East Asia and Australasia remained relatively unscathed with both low vaccination rates and low infection numbers, presumably because of early, strict lockdown measures).
Tools & Tutorials
Forecasting s-curves is hard
Researcher Constance Crozier
writes (https://constancecrozier.com/2020/04/16/forecasting-s-curves-is-hard/)about a topic that received a lot of attention and debate during the early stages of the pandemic: how to predict the trend in a sigmoid curve – functions that
“start with exponential growth, then increase linearly, and finally level off “
– as more data becomes available.
TL;DR: it’s hard. Some code is available, too.

“
Flat (https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data)explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub. It builds on the “git scraping” approach pioneered by Simon Willison to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and easier than working with data over the wire.

10 Positions Chess Engines Just Don’t Understand

Despite the clear superiority of engines, there ARE positions which chess engines don’t (and possibly can’t) understand that are quite comprehensible for human players. Typically
these positions (https://www.chess.com/article/view/10-positions-chess-engines-just-dont-understand)showcase the human ability to think creatively and formulate plans and understand long-term factors in the position.
“
I know just enough about chess to understand what this article is saying, and much less about automatic chess engines, but… doesn’t this issue strictly depend on the type of AI algorithm used – something that the article only acknowledges without further exploring it? I’d understand if the automatic player is using a traditional

Topi Tjukanov (https://twitter.com/tjukanov), GIS Consultant at
GISPO Ltd. (https://www.gispo.fi/en/home/)What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I work with geospatial data and open source software. My main tools are QGIS and PostGIS and besides using them myself I also train others how to use them.. As we do consulting for many different fields and domains, my data can be pretty much anything. During the last month I've worked with Finnish traffic sign locations, global Internet infrastructure cables, raster data on night-time lights, global population data and much much more. My typical data workflow is something like this: search data, clean data, clean more, merge it with something else, analyze it, visualize it.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
All my projects are data projects. Sort of. But I can't share all of the work I do during office hours, but all of the work I have on my personal
website (https://tjukanov.org/)have some sort of story behind them. But I'm really proud of having started the
#30DayMapChallenge (https://twitter.com/search), which has literally inspired thousands of amateur and professional map-makers to challenge themselves to making more maps.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
There are so many. I especially admire people who come up with new ideas, like
Alasdair Rae (http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/),
Maarten Lambrechts (https://twitter.com/maartenzam)or
Cartocalypse (https://twitter.com/cartocalypse). During COVID I've also admired
John Burn-Murdoch (https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch)'s work related to visualizing the pandemic.

Why we love the colour blue
Alex Selby-Boothroyd, The Economist's Data Journalism Dear Leader, writes in its "Off the charts"
newsletter (https://view.e.economist.com/)an interesting set of thoughts on colour blindness.
"
Another way to address colour clashes is to “fine tune” certain colours so that they are still recognisably “green” or “red” to most people, but noticeably different enough to our colour-blind readers.

Interesting episode of
The Tip Off podcast (https://play.acast.com/s/thetipoff/ep.53blackandwhitedata)on biased reporting and how data helped unearth the issue: “
Sarah Turnnidge started her journalism career at local papers so it was there she first encountered press releases from police forces. But over time Sarah started to wonder - did they tell the whole story. In this episode Sarah talks through her meticulous data project which revealed a worrying disproportionality when it came to information put out about black criminals.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to... Hillary Juma
Hillary Juma (https://twitter.com/HillaryJuma_)is Common Voice Community Manager at Mozilla and formerly Data Science community and Engagement Manager at the Data Science Campus of the Office for National Statistics.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I recently started my role at Mozilla Foundation  to support the
Common Voice (https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en)(CV) Community. Voice technology doesn’t currently serve every language community in the world.  
The CV community are helping us to build a publicly open source, multi-language dataset of voices that anyone can use to train speech-enabled applications.
Previously I was the Data Science Community Manager, for the UK Public Sector Data Science Community. To support and evaluate community activities, data from  Meet ups Eventbrite pages and community survey informed the design and delivery of
Data Science Community Programme (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/data-science-community). This helped ensure what I did as a community manager was relevant to members.
Data Ethics and Society reading group we (myself, Michael and Harriet) use GitHub repo to organise and communicate with members. Big thanks to DataKind UK’s Data Ethics in Book Club repo which we (myself, Harriet and Michael) modelled our reading group on.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
During my time at the Church of England, I worked with quantitative and qualitive data about Clergy and ordinands (people on their way to be priests) to help provide insight to the ministry division’s Diversity and Inclusion strategy. It was my first, real-word data project and I learned a lot about stakeholder engagement and storytelling.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Anything from The Pudding, in particular
How Bad is your Spotify ? (https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/). As The Pudding describes it,
This is a satirical project and does not use real artificial intelligence, but a faux pretentious music-loving AI. The code creates a custom blend of jokes from our database paired with the insights found in the artist, album, genre, and track data from your Spotify.
I like that it’s intentionally satirical and it made me expand my basic music tastes.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A paint palette, you can create something perceived as beautiful or intriguing or even ghastly. Brushes dance with colours to create stories about the present, past and future.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
(Slightly biased) Join a community! Communities are spaces for you to connect and engage with likeminded people. You can learn so much from your peers and give back as well. Check out communities such as the
Data Science Community (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/data-science-community)(Open to U.K Public Sector), or
Open Heroines (https://openheroines.org/)(Open to Women and non-binary people).
Data is or data are...
As long as the topic of data is/are accessible to people you’re communicating with, I’m unbothered.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Other than my month notes, I don’t blog that often anymore. Last week, I published a blog post and, unexpectedly, it
received (https://twitter.com/paul_clarke/status/1405483063728132097)quite (https://twitter.com/FaySimcock/status/1405234046876147720)a bit (https://twitter.com/ekaterinawilts/status/1405490580646420483)of love (https://twitter.com/darrenwaters/status/1405785737107283969)on social media. The article,
The top 9 lessons I’ve learned at work (https://puntofisso.medium.com/the-top-9-lessons-ive-learned-at-work-a2693b6e89b5), was about 10 years in the making: it’s the result of dozens of notes I’ve gathered in a text file with lessons I had learned about difficult situations at work. Feedback and comments are very welcome.

explains why he always releases his R source code alongside his charts (https://twitter.com/VictimOfMaths/status/1405809689246507010), making a cogent argument for openness and transparency as a way of learning more and transferring knowledge.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to... Miriam Quick & Duncan Geere
Miriam Quick (http://www.miriamquick.com)is a Freelance Data Journalist and Researcher;
Duncan Geere (http://www.duncangeere.com)is a Freelance Information Designer. Together, they are the creators of the data sonification podcast Loud Numbers. They are on Twitter as
@duncangeere (https://twitter.com/DuncanGeere)and
@miriamquick (https://twitter.com/miriamquick).
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
DG: To make sonifications for
Loud Numbers (https://www.loudnumbers.net/), we use Google Sheets to wrangle data, Sonic Pi to turn it into music, and then Logic Pro to turn that music into a track. For the scripts, we use Google Docs to write, Zencastr to record remotely, Descript to edit, and Logic again to sequence the episodes. For general comms and file-sharing we use Slack, Google Drive and Dropbox.
MQ: We start with a dataset that tells a strong story, then we create code sketches in Sonic Pi where we trial different ways of mapping the data to sound. We then export the audio from these into Logic Pro, adding effects and other sonic layers until the track sounds like music. We’re faithful to the dataset, though: once we’ve set up a sonification system we stick with it.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
MQ: My illustrated book with
Stefanie Posavec (https://www.stefanieposavec.com/),
I am a book. I am a portal to the universe (https://www.iamabook.online/). It makes data tangible for an all-ages audience. The direct precursors to Loud Numbers were
Oddityviz (https://www.oddityviz.com/), a David Bowie dataviz collaboration with
Valentina D’Efilippo (http://www.valentinadefilippo.co.uk/), and
Sleep Songs (https://miriamquick.com/sleep-songs)– my first attempt at turning data into music.
DG:  Does
Loud Numbers (https://www.loudnumbers.net/)count? 😅 If not, I’m very proud of the work I did last year for the
Drawdown Review (https://www.drawdown.org/drawdown-review)- visualizing the landscape of solutions to climate change. I’m also proud of the work I’m doing on
Car Free Cities (https://www.carfreemegacities.org/)for climate charity
Possible (https://www.wearepossible.org/).
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
DG: I really love
The Conditional Orchestra (https://theconditionalorchestra.com/)by Richard Bultitude, which generates procedural ambient music that reflects the weather conditions where you are, or at any other point on the Earth. It’s particularly impressive because it maps so many different variables but still creates something interesting and beautiful from it.
MQ: For the concept,
Ekene Ijeoma (https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ekene/overview/)’s
Deconstructed Anthems (https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/ekene-ijeoma-jazz-data-mass-incarceration-interview), which sonifies US mass incarceration data by removing notes from the Star Spangled Banner in a
live jazz performance (https://www.youtube.com/watch). I love the idea that silence can tell a more powerful story than sound. For sheer gorgeousness,
Nathan Ho’s Venn 7 (https://nathan.ho.name/venn7/)– a tool that turns all the overlaps in seven-way Venn diagrams into lush harmonies. I play with it often. 😀
If I say "dataset", you think of...
DG: Tempo, amplitude, volume, pitch and distortion.
MQ:
This artist (https://datassette.bandcamp.com/). A mate of mine was really into them back in the 2000s.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
DG: When sonifying data, don’t be afraid to add extra elements that are purely musical and not attached to the data. A simple drum loop, for example, can provide a sense of time passing in the same way that an axis would in a visualization, as well as making your sonification more enjoyable to listen to.
MQ: Less is often more with data sonification. In our first attempt at our launch track, based on climate change data from Alaska, we tried to sonify as many data layers as possible at once – like, six or seven or something. It didn’t work. We remade the track with just three data layers and it worked much better. Even one can be enough.
Data is or data are...
MQ: Data is!
DQ: Data is. This is a hill I will gladly die on.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
What a week, folks. I had my second jab on Thursday and felt a bit broken, but overall really happy to see the light at the end of the tunnel (which was, obviously, a side effect?). I managed to put in a few hours of work at  the allotment each evening, so to get ahead of potential vaccine-induced weakness.
In more interesting news, look below for a true star of data journalism: Marie Segger, data journalist at The Economist and lead author of their “Off the Charts” newsletter, answers this week’s Six Questions.
·
This deserves a special mention: Owen Boswarva’s
UK Addresses Primer (https://www.owenboswarva.com/blog/post-addr3.htm)has been updated. It’s one of the most comprehensive yet digestible articles you’ll read on the topic of open data about postal addresses (well, about the lack thereof, in reality).

I’ve otherwise been spending my evenings generating maps for my Etsy print shop, which is now mostly made of high-quality, fine-art giclée prints on heavy paper. There is a general
10% discount for newsletter readers
on
this link (https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Puntofisso).
However, if you recommend me a city location (using this

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to... Marie Segger
Marie Segger (https://twitter.com/MarieSegger)is a Data journalist at The Economist .
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My work looks very different each day, I research, write, edit and I also lead interviews for data-driven articles for
The Economist (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail). For data work I rely on Google sheets and
Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)and I'm still trying to get more consistent with my usage of
GitHub (https://github.com/).
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I'm very proud of our data newsletter. We launched "
Off the Charts (https://www.economist.com/offthecharts/)" at the beginning of the year and lift the curtain on the inner workings of The Economist's data team each week. We've written about the
data-vis tools we use (https://view.e.economist.com/),
how we source covid-19 data (https://view.e.economist.com/)and
why we rarely use polar charts (https://view.e.economist.com/), to name just a few examples. It's not really my work though—I'm just the editor and feel very lucky to work with such a brilliant team that has interesting things to say about the behind-the-scenes of their work every week. I also really hope that it helps make our data journalism more accessible.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I really like the New York Times's "
What's going on in this graph? (https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph)" series. It's a project aimed at teachers to help them educate students on all things data. I think data literacy is so important and it's great to see news outlets committed to increasing it—hopefully it means that we won't have to have discussions about whether readers understand scatter plots anymore in the future. I also loved the FT's "
Chart doctor (https://www.ft.com/chart-doctor)" column.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Cleaning.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Everyone else is learning by doing, too, so there is no need to feel insecure about things you don't know about (yet)! Ask all those questions you have and keep looking for opportunities (new projects!) to learn more.
Data is or data are...
The Economist style guide says "data are", so I'll have to go with that.

But what matters to us data folks is how easy it was for me to simply fork and edit the notebook, plug in the Friends data coming from Kaggle, and just run it. What a great product Observable is!

Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to... Alex Homer
Alex Homer (https://twitter.com/alexhomer)is a Senior Journalist at the BBC Shared Data Unit.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I'm a journalist first so my work starts with an editorial meeting discussing a tip or hypothesis I want to explore either independently or in a small team. Then it's sourcing the data I need whether that's finding open data, asking data holders for the data I need, making a request under the Freedom of Information Act or creating a dataset of my own. I speak to experts in whatever field to understand what the data show, any limitation or caveats I need to understand and then I do analysis - usually in Excel or Googlesheets, rarely but sometimes using R - and then carry out interviews to report on those findings.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I felt there was a big public interest in
my most recent investigation (https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/deaths-of-people-claiming-benefits), where I reported that cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm had led to more than 150 internal reviews by the Department for Work & Pensions(DWP) since 2012. I worked on this report independently for months including creating a dataset of press reports of individuals who had died after some interaction with the benefits system. Debbie Abrahams MP wrote in The Times RedBox it was a "watershed moment. Family members of other claimants who had died contacted me from all over the country and asked me to add their names to the list; they thought the deaths of their fathers, mothers, sisters, bothers, sons or daughters were isolated cases. Sadly, they are not.”
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I really admire a lot of projects by The Pudding but this was absolutely brilliant about
women's pockets (https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/)- the choice of subject, the scrollytelling presentation, the exploration of the reasons, the tone of voice - everything about it.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A source or interviewee if you like because journalists ask questions of datasets just as they would any other person.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
I wish I had appreciated sooner what I could have done if I'd learned to code when I was younger.
Data is or data are...
This is tough! I'd say data are because I am a pedant when it comes to grammar/verb conjugation etc.

Quantum of Sollazzo

Matteo Moretti of design studio Sheldon and one of my future “Six questions” interviewees, is leading this very interesting project,
Hyperobjects near and far (https://medium.com/iperogetti-vicini-e-lontani/tagged/english), a

that aims to shorten the distance between people in Venice – tourists and residents alike – to the global phenomena they’re involved with, including global warming and COVID-19. Hyperobject is a term created by philosopher Timothy Morton indicating a phenomena that invisibly conditions our present: we can feel their effects, but not touch or see them.
The

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to... Nithya Subramanian
Nithya Subramanian (http://twitter.com/nithya_sub)is a Data Designer at her own studio PoppadomCo.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I work in the intersection of data, semiotics, and storytelling. This means that I take on writing, storytelling and graphic design projects that pull in these different directions that I then try to resolve. I find the tension between data and storytelling fascinating, because we tend to think of data as a bloodless abstraction. But how to not lose that connection between the necessary abstraction of the data and the messiness of the story? I think that’s where semiotics comes in: signs and symbols – from within the story’s context and the wider culture – that a designer can use to their advantage to embed layers of meaning within a visualisation.
The tools I use vary by the project, and range from watercolours to code, although Photoshop and Illustrator usually play a part. Government data often comes in PDFs, so I find Tabula invaluable. Otherwise, the only thing I always have at hand is a notebook and pen.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I recently finished this
embroidered data visualisation (https://twitter.com/nithya_sub/status/1405003457115820034)of the plastic waste that was collected from beaches in three different countries. It was an exercise in patience: laying thousands of stitches as I counted them down in my spreadsheet. But looking at the data this way, instead of, say, in a column graph, made me think differently about it.
I also feel somewhat ambivalent about plastics (it’s highly visible, but maybe not the biggest problem the planet is currently facing) and thought embroidery was a good way to express this. The final visualisation is hopefully something that makes the viewer thoughtful, and not immediately incensed.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
There are many, but one that I keep returning to is
“I am a Book. I am a Portal to the Universe” (https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/314/314526/i-am-a-book--i-am-a-portal-to-the-universe-/9780241408759.html)by Stefanie Posavec and Miriam Quick. It’s such a delightful book! I never would have thought of it in a hundred years, so I’m just thrilled it exists.
The other one is this
aural data visualisation (https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/27/135737940/the-case-shiller-index-sung-as-opera)of the Case-Shiller home price index by the NPR Planet Money team, where they actually got a baritone from Juilliard to sing out the changing index. It was *so* clever.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
This Yes Minister clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch). It taught me to be healthily skeptical of datasets even as I work with them.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Get suspicious the moment you get too excited about an idea. I find excitement clouds judgement. Either your idea isn’t very good and you’re too excited to see that, or it is, but in your rush to execute it, you’ll miss chances to make it better.
Data is or data are...
I say “is”, but “are” doesn’t bother me. What I always get confused by is whether to pronounce it as dah-ta or day-ta.

Color naming across languages reflects color use
“
Across 110 languages, people can describe warm colors (yellow, red) more quickly than cool ones (blue, green). Why? Warm colors are more likely to describe objects (People holding handsCat) &  cool ones backgrounds (Deciduous treeWater wave).

How much hotter will it get in your lifetime?
“
When looking at charts about the increase in global temperature, I sometimes find myself asking:
What exactly does that mean for people living now — especially younger generations? (https://blog.datawrapper.de/how-much-hotter-will-it-get-in-your-lifetime/)“

#431: quantum of sollazzo – 20 July 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. This week's issue is brought to you by the heat and sunshine of Malta, which also offered a better broadband connection than I have at home in London. It's been a good week.
·
Look below for this week's "Six Questions" featured profile,
Sheldon Studio's co-founder Matteo Moretti
, a designer with a big passion for data. Among this week's links, you'll also find the incredible data visualization project he's led together with the European Data Journalism Network on visualizing the diversity of road names in major Italian towns.
·
"Quantum of Sollazzo" has joined the
pool of newsletters offered by "The Sample"
, which sends a random newsletter selected to suit your interests. It's an interesting experiment, and if you want to discover a few more newsletter please join from
this link (https://sample.findka.com/)(a referral link which will also boost Quantum's chances of being forwarded on).
I'd appreciate if you filled-in this short form to
tell The Pudding to add "Quantum of Sollazzo" to their list of resources for their automated Winning the Internet newsletter (https://forms.gle/h4trqT62V22doaAS9).

I don't do football much... but this
dataviz (https://twitter.com/TheDrum/status/1414945219619995656)is pretty clever: a BT ad which uses a
stylised England flag to visualize the level of abuse
received by its black players after the final match of Euro2020.
Not to mention
this other chart (https://twitter.com/marceldirsus/status/1415370032146681858). Which is actually connected to another interesting data visualization story, masterly narrated by Tim Harford in his recent "How to make the world add up". Here's
Tim (https://www.ft.com/content/4afa9f0e-dd62-11e4-975c-00144feab7de)with an article about it, and
some more about it (https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/04/27/how-to-mislead-with-how-to-lie-with-statistics/)from Colombia University.
Also, note how the chart only captures male deaths, a likely effect of the ways women's health was addressed back in those years, and an example of what I mean when I say that data is not neutral (and how this statement includes data collection).

Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Matteo Moretti
Matteo Moretti (https://twitter.com/teo_moretti)is co-founder of
Sheldon.studio (http://sheldon.studio). An award-winning designer, he explores new ways to connect information & experiences.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
We work at the intersection between information design, data visualization and social design, usually with small data and a strong concern on the experiential side of information. So we rely on a collaborative and humane centred design approach and work mainly with Around.co, Figma, Google Spreadsheet, Pencil & Paper.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
From the design point of view, I'm proud of this piece on
the Glocal Climate Change Design Process (https://nightingaledvs.com/data-enabling-the-glocal-climate-change-design-process/). We combined different data storytelling, design, and UX approaches to allow EU citizens to spot climate change in the places they care and then supporting a broader debate on climate change.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I'm a big fan of
illo.tv (http://illo.tv)people, especially their spin-off
algo.tv (http://algo.tv), which focuses on wonderful automated data in motion videos, such as their
COVID tracker (https://algo.tv/jhu-covid-tracker/)or
Serie A Stats (https://algo.tv/seriea/).
If I say "dataset", you think of...
"Let's hope someone already cleaned it."
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
"Data don't lie" is probably the biggest lie about data.
Data is or data are...
I'm Italian mother tongue, so I tend to use "are". However, I struggle every time I read, hear, or use "is": it sounds completely strange to my mind….

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. This has been a relatively quiet week, and I haven’t found that much data stuff around, especially in data journalism, so this is a slightly less visual issue than usual. I bet all writers and data wranglers are taking some well-deserved holidays (while developer-thinkers clearly are not).

What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
Acquiring, cleaning/analysing and visualising data for the news. Google sheets for creating datasets, VSCode as a text editor. Github for version control, sharing work. Notion for research and notetaking. A whiteboard, pen and paper cause the mind moves in many directions. Node.js for scripted data extraction/analysis. R for scripted analysis/static viz/prototyping. Illustrator for finishing up. d3.js for bespoke and interactive visualisations.
Common workflows for viz:
for static viz - d3.js/R/Datawrapper/Rawgraphs → Illustrator → ai2html
for interactive viz - html/css/js with d3.js
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
COVID-19 vaccine rollout: charts, maps and eligibility by country (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/).
There were tons of dashboards around COVID across the world. However, this offered more context. Often trying to tell a story amidst a space where people are mostly staring at a wall of numbers. It was a team effort, but I am particularly proud of how the UX for top globe turned out + vaccine equity charts in a dashboard!
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
These simulations show how to flatten the coronavirus growth curve (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)In the news industry we often think about impact - something that is usually hard to measure. You want something to improve in society because of your work. And Harry's piece did exactly that. It was at a time when we needed to understand the need for social distancing. And even if a handful of people stayed at home because of this piece (I assume it was actually more), that is the BEST kind of impact. Apart from being the most read article in the history of Washington Post, they also translated it to multiple other languages.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
jsons and csvs
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Your dream dataset does not exist.
Data is or data are...
I believe... data is plural (obviously inspired from JS Vine's awesome newsletter). 🙈

For SQL
If you’ve read last week’s “Against SQL” article,

“
I don’t doubt that there is a world where
churn[['State','Score']].groupby('State').mean().sort_values(by='Score', ascending=False)is more useful than
SELECT state, AVG(score) 
FROM churn 
GROUP BY state order by score;
But there are many worlds where the latter is more than just fine.

Ahmad (https://twitter.com/bothness)is Census Data Vis Lead, Office for National Statistics.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
Building interactive data visualisations as much as I can when I can find the time in the day. Using a lot of Svelte, a Javascript framework which is great for rapid prototyping. The rest of the time I’ll be managing my team, and attending planning and coordination meetings with people from across the ONS involved in Census 2021, from data, to analysis, to dissemination.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Palestine Open Maps (https://palopenmaps.org/). This project was my gateway drug into web mapping and front-end development. We stitched together 200+ historic maps and made them navigable, searchable and downloadable.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Morphocode Explorer (https://explorer.morphocode.com/). A tool that allows you to explore neighbourhood level data in maps and charts. I love the choice of data, how it’s visualised, and just how goddam smooth the whole user experience is.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Spreadsheets. It doesn’t matter how many ways I manipulate and visualise data, I can’t break that datasets = 2-dimensional tables link in my mind.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
D3 doesn’t have all the answers. Don’t be ashamed of using tools like Excel and Illustrator to create static data visualisations. They’re often the fastest and most effective tools available, and Illustrator gives you complete control over the look and feel of the final visual.
Data is or data are...
Is… but that’s probably not what it says in the ONS style guide.

New Data Leads To Rethinking (Once More) Where The Pandemic Actually Began
Conspiracy? No conspiracy?

Machine-learning on dirty data in Python: a tutorial
“
Often in data science, machine-learning applications spend a significant energy preparing, tidying, and cleaning the data before the machine learning.
Here (http://dirtydata.science/python/)we give a set of Python tutorials on how some of these operations can be simplified with adequate machine-learning tools.
“
This is in fact a series of hands-on tutorials. It still seems (mostly) under construction, but there’s some good material in it already.
Towards Inserting One Billion Rows in SQLite Under A Minute
This article (https://avi.im/blag/2021/fast-sqlite-inserts/)is slightly on the techie side, but it might provide you with some very useful tips to speed up your inserts, which may be handy if you are trying to ingest a lot of data before an analysis.

The Big Mac index
As you might know, since 1986 The Economist has been calculating and releasing a MacDonalds-based tool that captures exchange-rate theory. In recent years they have created an
interactive currency comparison tool (https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index)and the index itself has gone from 15 currencies to the current 57. The updates are explained in a recent

Lisa Charlotte Rost
Lisa ([https://twitter.com/lisacrost](https://twitter.com/lisacrost))is responsible for communications (especially the blog) at Datawrapper.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I <3 the combination of numbers and design. After visualizing data in and for newsrooms, I made it my job to help other people create better charts. I write
blog posts (https://blog.datawrapper.de/)and Datawrapper how-to guides, help my coworkers write their
Weekly Charts (https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/weekly-charts/), test new Datawrapper features, and then
announce them.
When creating data vis myself, I mostly use R or Google Sheets for cleaning up and analyzing the data, and then, yes, you guessed it, Datawrapper to visualize it. (https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/datawrapper-news/)Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
My coworker
Rose Mintzer-Sweeney (https://twitter.com/rosemintzers)and I launched the
Data Vis Dispatch (https://blog.datawrapper.de/category/data-vis-dispatch/)a while ago, a weekly collection of "The best of big and small data visualizations." Like this newsletter, it's a way to stay up to date about the scene and good projects — without spending hours on Twitter each day (we take care of that!).
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
So many! The last one was Josh Katz's
Tokyo Olympics: Who Leads the Medal Count? (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/27/upshot/which-country-leads-in-the-olympic-medal-count.html)It answers a question I had and perfectly combines geekiness, beautiful colors and shapes, and exploration.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
"Ooooh shiny, numbers!"
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Side projects don't need to be perfect to be released into the wild. Something that's 80% there will still inspire and inform people more than something that's never published.

Ranking European regions by Olympics medals
Giorgio Comai e Lorenzo Ferrari of the European Data Journalism Network have created this
medal table (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Ranking-European-regions-by-Olympics-medals)based on the regional, rather than national, status of their winner, using NUTS2 regions in EuroStat.
Tokyo Olympics: The alternative medal tables
“
A country’s economy is strongly linked to the number of medals it can win, so can we measure a win at the Olympics another way?
“
On a similar note to the previous link, Sky News
looks at GDP and population (https://news.sky.com/story/tokyo-olympics-the-alternative-medal-tables-12362040).
Olympians are probably older — and younger — than you think
“
There were some outliers in the old days, but even in Tokyo, athletes range from boomers through Gen Z”
. Interesting
piece (https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/07/31/oldest-youngest-olympians/)of data wrangling by the Washington Post, showing that, effectively, the youngest-oldest range has not reduced much in 50 years.

Where Are The Robotic Bricklayers?

When researching construction, you invariably discover that any new or innovative idea has actually been tried over and over again, often stretching back decades. One of these new-but-actually-old ideas is the idea of a mechanical bricklayer, a machine to automate the construction of masonry walls.
“
This article (https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/where-are-the-robotic-bricklayers)is about automation of repetitive tasks more than it is specifically about AI, but the two concepts are intimately related.
AI Takes the Stage at the Summer Olympics
“
For example (https://www.datanami.com/2021/07/28/ai-takes-the-stage-at-the-summer-olympics/), Omega, which is the official timekeeper for 35 Olympic sports, is using cameras equipped with computer vision capabilities to track the movement of beach volleyball players, as well as the ball.

Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Neil Richards
, who's been gifting the Twittersphere with some awesome Tableau charts over the past few years.
·
'till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Neil Richards
Neil (http://twitter.com/theneilrichards)is EMEA BI Lead at JLL.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My daily work is mostly creating Tableau BI dashboards at JLL with a bit of project management thrown in, though I also love elements of the job that involve growing the internal data community and promoting data literacy. But I’m probably better known online for my personal projects on Tableau Public or my blog at
questionsindataviz.com (http://questionsindataviz.com/)- once I’m outside the environs of the day job I love to be a bit more creative and unconventional.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Most of my data projects are on my Tableau Public profile
here (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/neil.richards)- in particular my most recent project (at time of submitting answers!) is
here (https://public.tableau.com/views/HowGlobalistheOlympicGames/MedalMap)- I had a lot of fun with this one basically just designing a new map from scratch and I’m pretty pleased the way it came out
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Where do I start?! So many to choose from but I’m going to go with
OddityViz (http://oddityviz.com/)by Valentina d’Efilippo and Miriam Quick. I love how Miriam sees music in data and data in music (I couldn’t think which way round that was, but it’s definitely both!). And then with Valentina’s visual creativity it’s a perfect partnership!
If I say "dataset", you think of...
"Ooh - new project!" Sounds pretentious but the dataset is what I use as a creative medium, precisely because I have no talent in wielding a pencil, moulding clay … or indeed anything conventionally artistic or creative. So a new dataset is a chance for a brand-new visual creation (of course, that’s the “rose-tinted” glasses view that assumes it’s clean, interesting and packed full of amazing untold stories!)Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Don’t be put off or overwhelmed by what you see others create - just dive in and enjoy the process, the more “fun” the project is to you, for whatever reason, the faster you’ll learn. Oh, and it’s “CHORopleth” - there’s no L in it. Took me years to realise I had that one wrong!
Data is or data are...
Definitely Data is. I know it's a plural noun in Latin, but its derivation is just like “agenda”, so it’s singular in English. Though to be fair I can tolerate either - just so long as you don’t pronounce it “dah-ta”!

)Data thinking
Free to view online newspaper released from the British Library
As Terence Eden
notes (https://twitter.com/edent/status/1424723348051931140)on Twitter, "
The British Library keeps to a ‘safe date’ when determining when a newspaper can be considered to be entirely out-of-copyright, which is 140 years after the date of publication.
", which feels a tad long.
This comes from
this announcement (https://blogs.bl.uk/thenewsroom/2021/08/free-to-view-online-newspapers.html)about the release of 19th century newspapers.
The Art of Nomography
"
Prior to the widespread of computers,
graphic calculation methods (https://kartsci.org/kocomu/computer-history/the-art-of-nomography/)were a popular means of quickly solving scientific and technical problems, that would otherwise have required tedious calculations. This is distinct from graphical representation of data obtained numerically using computers, that we widely use today, for illustration purposes and to get a qualitative “feeling” of the behaviour of physical quantities as a function of some parameters.
"
Basically, nomographs were a way to use graphics in order to derive data, which is conceptually exactly the opposite of data visualization.

The data newsletter by

Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or

We're approaching 500 issues of "quantum". Not sure how I feel about it, other than I'm very bad at letting go of things, especially when they're fun :) But I'm happy about the niche and cosy feeling that this newsletter has developed over time. Thank you for being a part of it.

Last week I gave a keynote about AI in the NHS to the Transport for London Analyst Conference. It was my first time back in front of a live audience since 2020 and I really enjoyed it. I had forgotten the excitement of being in front of 100+ pair of eyes! I also can't remember ever getting so many questions, from an audience that was not my usual audience: presenting AI in healthcare to a crowd of transport analysts and data scientists was probably one of the biggest "semantic distances" I've ever had to bridge. It did not disappoint – I ended up staying for the whole conference, and I learned more than I thought, especially thanks to a few presentations about NLP and AI vision.
I'll present a variation of this talk again in November to a public health audience, then I'll try to publish a write-up that brings the two together and addresses the questions raised.

Over 800 examples (https://www.supermind.design/database)of real-life building blocks of collective intelligence, augmented by digital technologies - useful when designing new solutions, e.g. during innovation workshops, as they provide practices and most importantly analogies to stimulate creativity.

To do so, you want to engage the social and market systems and their organic, exponential properties instead of relying on traditional hierarchical mechanisms.

Within minutes of seeing the results, Anne would find a plausible explanation of why they were entirely compatible with her view. Anne was always very clever, but at those moments she would become quite extraordinary, able to come up with arguments that surprised and silenced me. Then I would go back to the drawing board, design another experiment, and it would all happen again. I was the aggressor in those games until Anne became exasperated and designed a critical test of my view. I agreed to the challenge. The results came in as Anne had expected, but it was my turn to get my 15 points, and I rejected the rejection of my theory. That was the end of that particular game.

Understanding open data: legal openness (https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx): “
In order to unleash the full potential of data, it needs to be legally open. This means the data must be placed in the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal restrictions. Organisations and governments use open data licenses to explain the conditions under which their data can be used. Data owners need to take decisions regarding legal openness of their data when making it available to the public.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.

I write most of this from a relatively warm and dry Berlin. It's good to be back – I was last here before the pandemic. Forgive the slightly shorter-than-usual issue :)The best bit of last week was
The Times using (https://twitter.com/tomhcalver/status/1589213064808669185)my website
Parli-N-Grams (https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/)for one of their electoral analyses. If you are a long-standing subscriber of Quantum, you'll have heard about Parli-N-Grams before. It's a website that acquired an unlikely life of its own after I built it in just a few hours for a hackathon in 2014, then touched it very little, and it still keeps running and updating daily, using the amazing data coming from mySociety's TheyWorkForYou. This appearance in the Times is the second time it's been featured in the media , after it was used by Allegra Stratton on ITV Peston on Sunday, a feat that got yours truly named as
Peston's Geek of the Week (https://twitter.com/itvpeston/status/972787174235148288). Which reminds me, I should really refresh that tacky UI...

Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or

Holiday project: I'm putting together a
Quantum of Sollazzo reading list
. Which books would you recommend and why?
·
Also, introducing
Consensus Chess
, an experimental new take on the classic game! In Consensus Chess, players on social media can vote on the move they would like their side to make. It creates a collaborative and inclusive experience, and allows players to learn from each other and improve their skills together.
Consensus Chess is a personal project from
Lewis Westbury (https://instantiator.dev/), developed over November this year to scratch an itch. Effort has gone into making the game accessible, with comprehensive descriptive text generated for each new board graphic. All feedback and improvement suggestions are welcome.
To play, simply visit
icgames@botsin.space (https://botsin.space/@icgames)(on Mastodon), and vote for the move you would like to see your side make. Once the votes are in, the move with the most votes is executed, and the game continues. You can find out more at
icgames.net (https://icgames.net/).

Although this guide is mostly aimed at Machine Learning pipelines, I think it will also be useful if you’re trying to do any type of data analysis that requires heavy data cleaning and calculations that go beyond the mere average/median/etc. Repository is
here (https://github.com/Yimeng-Zhang/feature-engineering-and-feature-selection), with the TOC

Pixel Accurate Atkinson Dithering for Images in HTML
“
There are other ways of crushing a multicolored image down to 1-bit monochrome but I think Atkinson’s method produces quite striking results that I thought
would (https://sheep.horse/2022/12/pixel_accurate_atkinson_dithering_for_images_in_ht.html)look neat on the modern web.
“
I find dithering rather intriguing, for some reason. Dithered images have some interesting properties, including the fact that resizing ruins them way more than for non-dithered pictures.
The peculiarity of the approach in this article is that it is done in the UI thread (all code is
here (https://github.com/andrewstephens75/as-dithered-image)).

#499: quantum of sollazzo – 3 January 2023
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
I write this issue as I start preparing for New Year's Eve. The best part of it, is that I'll spend it having dinner with a few friends at my neighbours' flat. It's great to have local friends :) Overall, it's been a quiet week. I visited family in Italy, saw friends, had way too much food; I spent 24h in Naples, a city I had never seen, with Daniele Guido Gessa, a journalist friend who introduced me to all the best sights... and had way too much food (and coffee, OH the coffee in Naples is something from another planet). When you read this, it will be 2023. I hope the new year brings good things to you. Thanks for being a reader of QoS :)·
I started putting together a
Quantum of Sollazzo bookshop
, after I realised I had a growing readling list to recommend. I might start a book club or something at some point.
The required disclaimer: if you end up buing from the link below, I get a commission. It's a good way to support QoS if you wish to, but even better: go to your local independent bookshop and order the book from them. Of course, you're welcome to encourage the bookshop staff to subscribe to Quantum ;-).

The cold hard truth about electric vehicles in winter
Axios looks at
EV battery performances (https://www.axios.com/2022/03/04/the-cold-hard-truth-about-electric-vehicles-in-winter).
This reminds me of two things. First, someone I know had to take a trip in a EV from Cornwall to London in freezing conditions a few years ago, and it took him about 6 stops because the battery wouldn't last over 30 minutes. Unless massive technology improvements happen (which, from what I understand, are unlikely to bring the order of magnitude required), a better low-carbon model would be to avoid EVs for long journeys. The second thing is on how to reduce the amount of cars circulating, as EV don't address the congestion issue: a recent trip to Bologna, Italy, was rather eye opening – I ended up in a peak hour traffic jam, which is a regular occurrence there. Most of the traffic was made up of cars occupied exclusively by their driver.

ChatGPT: confidently wrong
I
played (https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/1606686421711888385)a little with ChatGPT to see how it fails (gracefully or not), and settled on the idea of asking it to solve problems with strict constraints. 
So I asked it to create a... diet plan. A super low-carb diet plan, with other crazy demands, inspired by a few of my eating experiments of the past decade. The outcome is clear: it fails, quite blatantly, but it confidently gives the wrong answer. Even more interestingly, it does admit the error when asked, but its correction is wrong again.
