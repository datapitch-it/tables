#436: quantum of sollazzo – 24 August 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week.
The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
I’ve been very busy and travelling this week, so it’s a slightly less dense issue of Quantum than usual.
·
Every week I include a six-questions interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Clara Guibourg
of Newsworthy, whose interactive climate data investigations and applications you might have seen featured in Quantum of Sollazzo over the years.

If you’re looking for a #ddj job, the BBC are hiring a
data journalist for South Asia Visual Journalism team (https://twitter.com/petesherlock79/status/1428614851363016712).

Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Clara Guibourg
Clara (http://twitter.com/cguibourg)is a data journalist at Newsworthy.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I work with “automating” local data journalism, finding the right angle on a story for each Swedish municipality, say. My typical workflow starting a new project is: research, find data, clean, clean, clean again, analyse and visualise. This part is all heavily R-based.  
The next part is writing hundreds of local articles. Thankfully, I don’t have to do this by hand, but instead use the homemade “robot writer” my clever colleagues
Jens (https://twitter.com/jensfinnas)and
Leo (https://twitter.com/leo_wallentin)have developed. This is a Node.js-based interface which generates text from data and makes it possible to write dynamic articles with programmatic logic.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
How much worse are heat waves going to get in your municipality? (https://www.newsworthy.se/sv/dashboard/newslead/96460/)I was pleased with the way this combined modelled temperature data and population projections to show a granular picture of the parts of Sweden that can expect to face greatest health risks from heat waves in future, with a combination of many hot days and a large elderly population.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
So many! I’m especially interested in climate data, but it can often feel quite abstract. So I’m always looking for good examples where the topic is covered in a tangible and engaging way. Recently I enjoyed
NYT’s article (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/30/opinion/environmental-inequity-trees-critical-infrastructure.html)on tree cover inequality, a really smart analysis of neighbourhoods’ median income and canopy cover (or lack thereof).
ProPublica’s maps (https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/)showing the effects on a “transformed United States” were also really good, not least the way they combine specific effects on things like sea level and crop yields into a total climate risk index county by county.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Excel. I barely work with it these days, but somehow this is still how “data” looks to me.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
There’s always something wrong with the data. Take the time to explore the data and find out what it is early on, it’s much less stressful to tackle then than when you discover the problem right before hitting the publish button.
Data is or data are...
Data is. No question!

In many cities, it is becoming too hot to work
Patrick Scott, writing for CityMonitor,
shows (https://citymonitor.ai/community/public-health/in-many-cities-it-is-becoming-too-hot-to-work)that “
the number of high heat days is increasing rapidly across the world, and the implications for businesses are profound.
“
Productivity seems to be badly affected by climate change, especially in terms of excess heat (unsurprisingly for me, having worked for a couple of summers in Bologna, with 38C and 90% humidity).
Days with extreme heat are likely becoming more frequent
As a way to compound what we’ve learned in the article above, here’s Datawrapper’s Gregor Aisch
taking a look (https://blog.datawrapper.de/days-with-extreme-heat/)at a way “
to make warming degrees a little less abstract and a little more scary.

How to map Rio de Janeiro’s six million residents
Brilliant
write-up (https://view.e.economist.com/)by Marie Segger and colleagues on the Economist’s Off The Charts newsletter.
“
A few weeks ago Sarah Maslin, our Brazil correspondent, asked our team if a dot-density map that she had come across in her research could accompany her piece about racial segregation in Rio de Janeiro. The map showed each of the city’s 6m residents as a single dot, with different colours denoting their skin colour. Unfortunately, we could not get hold of the underlying data for the map—so we had to recreate the numbers ourselves. In theory, it was a straightforward task: we had to combine the demographic data from the Brazilian census with the geographical information of each census tract within Rio de Janeiro. This would tell us how many people are located within each area, alongside their racial identification: branco (white), pardo (mixed) or preto (black). As anyone who has ever dabbled in any kind of programming knows, nearly every problem has been solved before.

(via Francesco Bucci)Why Dynamic Data Visualization Is Key to Covering Climate Change
"
Like many people, the first graph I ever saw explaining climate change was in a school geography textbook. It showed the “hockey stick” curve of the Earth’s surface temperature over time, which has become one of the world’s most recognizable line graphs. [...]
One
challenge (https://gijn.org/2021/08/17/why-dynamic-data-visualization-is-key-to-covering-climate-change/)of understanding the information contained in this hockey stick graph — and this is a gift to climate-change deniers — is the inclusion of the gray fuzz of “uncertainty data”: outlying data points that can be cherry-picked to raise doubts about the mass of evidence supporting a general warming trend.

#439: quantum of sollazzo – 14 July 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
This tweet of mine generated a few interesting replies. Fundamentally, there is no/little data to address this question extensively, mostly because exactly what "company headquarters" are is an ill-defined concept. Effectively, the easiest option would be a company's registered office, but this often not a real office. There's a question of size, too: is the HQ of a company the office where most of its employees work? Where the CEO works? Where most of the production is carried out? These questions will apply in different ways to different companies (and sectors).
But I also realise that my original question should be rephrased to something like "
what other companies have a large office in teh outskirts that feels like a village?
". Because that's what feels "odd" about McDonald's having its HQ – and, in this case, registered office – in N2: the fact that East Finchley is fundamentally one of those old fashioned, suburbian villages with a high street that isn't just a dorm-town, it's a commuting residential area but with its own life that is somewhat dependant upon belonging to the London ecosystem.
On this topic, read
this interesting thread (https://twitter.com/dradam676/status/1288921657898422272)by Adam Gripton, which looks at the distance between company offices and the nearest public transport access point. Matt Ballantine pointed out that there is a dataset that can give some limited insight into
companies in the FTSE 250 (https://www.londonstockexchange.com/indices/ftse-250/constituents/table). He's also done
this map for the FTSE100. (https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer).
Meanwhile, David Kane made

How the pandemic set back women’s progress in the global workforce
"
Of the women who lost jobs in 2020, almost 90 percent exited the labor force completely, compared with around 70 percent of men.
"

How the Social Democrats came to lead the German polls, up-close
Lisa Charlotte Muth of Datawrapper
looks again at what's happening in the German electoral polls (https://blog.datawrapper.de/social-democrats-lead-german-polls-chart-september-2021/), for the upcoming federal election. This is seeing a surprise recovery of the SPD versus their CDU-CSU rivals, but the data analysis also shows how "
different time spans can give readers different insights
".
Open House London Data

Sustainable transport planning etc
ICYMI, Robin Lovelace, a transport academic and R guru, developed the
stplanr (https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/)package, which "
provides functions for solving common problems in transport planning and modelling, such as how to best get from point A to point B
". It was co-founded by the UK Department of Transport, and some of my former team mates were involved in this.
As Robin himself
highlights (https://twitter.com/robinlovelace/status/1436253002525028362), this package has now been used for an entirely different purpose:
calculating the distance to tuberculosis clinics in Africa (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/clinical-health-systems-and-neighbourhood-determinants-of-tuberculosis-case-fatality-in-urban-blantyre-malawi-a-multilevel-epidemiological-analysis-of-enhanced-surveillance-data/F18F42BE454F5EAFDB2FDD27DDDACC1E).
htmlq
htmlq (https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq)is "

If you're not familiar with jq, it's a command-line tool to parse JSON files on the fly and extract useful content (e.g. for data exploration, etc...); htmlq does exactly the same for HTML files.
Introduction to Bayesian Linear Regression
"
An
explanation (https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-linear-regression-e66e60791ea7)of the Bayesian approach to linear modeling
". Just in case you need it ;-)Where do you stand on the frequentist vs Bayesian debate? The author says: "
in problems where we have limited data or have some prior knowledge that we want to use in our model, the Bayesian Linear Regression approach can both incorporate prior information and show our uncertainty.

Recently I've been looking at the
Fitzpatrick Scale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale), which is a classification of human skin colour. Originally developed in dermatology to describe skin shades, I've been reading about it while researching how to address bias in data for AI applications and coming up with obvious questions, such as "
if we need to collect images on which to build a machine learning model, what is the best unbiased distribution of images on the Fitzpatrick Scale?
".
In other words, is it best to have an equal number of images per step in the scale (a uniform distribution), or should images be allocated according to some other distribution? And this is assuming that the best approach is to create a single model as opposed to, for example, a separate model per step on the scale. All of this is very abstract, of course, and might be necessary to know the full context of the application in order to really understand what's right to do.
Interestingly, the Fitzpatrick Scale is also the basis for
emoji skin modifiers (https://emojipedia.org/emoji-modifier-sequence/).
The Fitzpatrick scale and the risk of skin cancer, CC BY 3.0, John D’Orazio et al. "UV Radiation and the Skin" Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14(6), 12222-12248; doi:10.3390/ijms140612222

Possession Is The Puzzle Of Soccer Analytics. These Models Are Trying To Solve It.
"
In 2011, a software developer named Sarah Rudd got fed up with conventional soccer stats. It was easy to count how many passes a player attempted and completed, but not all passes are equal. “We know passing percentage is a terrible metric for evaluating how good of a passer you are,” she told me. What were those actions really worth?

Why data scientists shouldn’t need to know Kubernetes
"
This post (https://huyenchip.com/2021/09/13/data-science-infrastructure.html)is to argue that while it’s good for data scientists to own the entire stack, they can do so without having to know K8s if they leverage a good infrastructure abstraction tool that allows them to focus on actual data science instead of getting YAML files to work.
"
Yes. And no. :-)Maybe I link this up too much to my own experience, but in my case the key to having fun at work and being productive implied both some degree of specific knowledge as well as a good generalist approach. And I don't mean just now, when I'm doing very little technical work – this was even more true when I had a data centre with 300 servers running the most disparate services and platforms, and a total team of 3 to run it.

Phantom Islands – A sonic atlas
“
Phantom Islands are artifacts of the age of maritime discovery and colonial expansion. During centuries of ocean exploration these islands were sighted, charted, described and even explored – but their existence has never been ultimately verified. Poised somewhere between cartographical fact and maritime fiction, they haunted seafarers’ maps for hundreds of years, inspiring legends, fantasies, and counterfactual histories.
Phantom Islands – A Sonic Atlas (http://andrewpekler.com/phantom-islands/)interprets and presents these imaginations in the form of an interactive map which charts the sounds of a number of historical phantom islands.

The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
·
Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Ashley Kirk
of The Guardian, who you, reader of “Quantum of Sollazzo”, will surely know as I’ve featured his amazing data analysis and visualization work over and over again.
Meanwhile, past interviewee
Topi Tjukanov
, master of geographic visualization, has launched his traditional yearly “30 Day Maps Challenge”, which is all about pushing yourself to create a map a day during the month of November. All details
here (https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1443868144905428992)and on
GitHub (https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge).

‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Ashley Kirk
Ashley (https://twitter.com/Ashley_J_Kirk )is Visual Projects Editor at The Guardian
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
No two days are the same as it all depends on what story I’m working on. But normally a story will start with a question - why is this particular thing happening? How is this issue changing over time? Who is experiencing it? Once I have a question, I’ll try to source data that helps me answer it - whether a simple open spreadsheet or more complex, unstructured data. Next, I’ll analyse the data and find answers that usually will lead to a story. R, or Sheets for quicker jobs, are my tools of choice. I’ll then talk to some experts and see how best to communicate my story to our audience. This may involve static charts, interactives or text. My visualisation tools of choice are usually R/ ggplot, QGIS and Illustrator.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I think the stories I’ve been most proud of are the ones that have delivered exclusive news while utilising the best visual journalism practices to communicate that story online. A recent example is a collaboration with my brilliant colleagues
Cath Levett (https://twitter.com/CathLevett)and
Pablo Gutiérrez (https://twitter.com/pablo_gutierrez), where we gathered Flightradar24 data to
analyse the flight traffic coming in and out of Kabul airport (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/25/evacuating-afghanistan-a-visual-guide-to-flights-in-and-out-of-kabul)as the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. This piece performed very well as it provided new context on a timely issue that people wanted to hear more about. And, crucially, couldn't have been done without the data work. The freedom of information work I conducted in my previous role at the Telegraph also comes to mind, such as when I revealed that crime victims had to wait over
half an hour for police to respond to 999 calls as response times double (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/13/crime-victims-wait-half-hour-police-respond-999-calls-response/)...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I really enjoyed
this analysis from Josh Holder and Amy Schoenfeld Walker at the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/24/world/vaccines-seniors.html)looking at the proportion of unvaccinated elderly people in the US and internationally. Going into winter, this will be the story to watch: how much protection do we actually have when the virus gets a seasonal boost? A lot of this will depend on how many vulnerable people are still not fully vaccinated, and their analysis reveals how the US is lagging behind. This is the sweet spot for me: data analysis that provides a new story on a topical issue. In addition, I really liked the use of visualisation. The beeswarms effectively show the disparities within each country and allow the reader to immediately see which country is struggling the most with their vaccination campaign.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A nice, clean table of text and/ or numbers. I know that’s not usually the case but it’s what I picture in my head. Maybe that’s wishful thinking.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Be brave, think out of the box and keep pitching ideas. In my opinion, the ability to constantly think of new ideas is the key skill of a data journalist. You can be the best data cruncher or programmer in the world, but ultimately, these skills you’ve built up are only a means to an end. For a data journalist, the end is the story itself - and this is what ultimately matters. So keep thinking of new story ideas that are exciting for your readers, and keep pitching them to your editors. Don’t be afraid to fail - keep pushing the boundaries, even if one pitch doesn’t work, and constantly think about not only new topics but also new ways to visualise your stories.
Data is or data are...
Data is. I know it’s not technically right but it’s just easier.

Edurne Morillo
of Datawrapper.

Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Edurne Morillo
Edurne (https://twitter.com/EdurneMG)is a support engineer and content writer at Datawrapper.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I spent most of my day helping others to make data visualizations, so I’m used to seeing a wide variety of tools, workflows, and data sources. Some people send their data as an Excel file, while others use a Python script. I find it very enriching to learn about different approaches to data analysis and visualization and to try and incorporate those into my workflow. For personal projects, I usually go for Jupyter Notebooks, and Google Spreadsheets to analyze my data and then visualize it using Datawrapper (I guess this is not a surprise to anyone!).
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Each week, a member of the Datawrapper team writes an article for our Blog featuring Datawrapper visualizations. We call these ‘Weekly Charts’. I’ve enjoyed working on each of the ones I’ve written so far, but if I have to mention just one, I think that must be this one:
How Barcelona is claiming its streets back from cars (https://blog.datawrapper.de/barcelona-urban-planning-superblocks/). I’m pretty new to mapping, so it’s always nice to have a chance to make some!
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I feel I’m still relatively new to the field, so I naturally look up to many people and data teams. Since the latest Outlier conference, I’m obsessed with
Kontinentalist (https://twitter.com/konti_sg). I find their style very refreshing, and I like how they translate cultural experiences into data stories. To give you an example, here’s an article from Mick Yang about the importance of
chili in Asia (https://kontinentalist.com/stories/chilli-peppers-and-spicy-sauces-in-asia).
If I say "dataset", you think of...
An interview! My background is in journalism, so I treat datasets as I would treat interviewees; I make questions until I get the full picture of something.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Less is, usually, more. When I started making data visualizations, I thought it was better to use complicated chart types, including animations and many interactive features, but now I try to think about what my story calls for. I recommend this article by my colleague Lisa called
In defense of simple charts (https://blog.datawrapper.de/in-defense-of-simple-charts/).
Data is or data are...
I believe the right thing would be ‘data are’, but to be completely honest, I always find myself using ‘data is’ instead, and ‘data are’ just sounds wrong to me.

I travelled to Iceland last week, seeing recent volcanic eruptions and feeling the heat still coming out of the lava, walking inside a glacier, and bathing in natural hot springs. But one of my favourite trips was to see the famous DC-3 plane wreck, something that’s been on my list for years and that I wanted to see before it fatally crumbles – it’s literally dusting away as the years pass.
But… the wreckage also offers some reflections, as in my
tweet below (https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/1448652659108368396). There were 7 people on board of that plane when it crash-landed, and they all survived. However, at least 2 people have died in connection with it: tourists trying to visit the wreckage while ill-equipped or not fully informed.
Risk-assessment is highly contextual
. My picture below captures what is – by Icelandic October standards – a glorious day. But weather in Iceland is highly changing, even more than in Britain. A snow storm is always a possibility. High winds could make walking hard for people who are not at the top of their fitness. Would you believe that walking on a flat 2.8km walk could kill you and that crash-landing in the middle of a desert could not?

This sample could then be used to generate and test keyword-based rules for automatic classification of charities, as well as training machine-learning models.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Prukalpa Sankar
Prukalpa (http://twitter.com/prukalpa)is co-founder at Atlan.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
Unfortunately, I don’t get to actually work with data as much as I’d like in my current role, because I’m spending most of my time running Atlan, which helps other data teams around the world. But the data stack has become so amazing in the last few years. If I got a chance to get my hands dirty again, I’d love for my stack to be a data warehouse like Snowflake; dbt for data transformation; Looker, Mode, and Sigma on analytics; and Atlan, of course, as the collaborative workspace.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Our work with the Government of India (https://www.youtube.com/watch)in bringing clean cooking fuel to 80m women below the poverty line. By leveraging dynamic monitoring and analytics, it became the first government program in India to surpass its annual target by 22%. Part of this project was opening 10,000 new fuel distribution centers, which was complex because we were balancing two conflicting questions — profitability and accessibility (i.e. a center within 10 kms of every home). We ended up mapping India’s 600k+ villages, layering 600+ datasets, and running a geo-clustering algorithm to identify the best locations.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
There’s so much happening these days, but I want to call out the data projects that researchers, scientists, and analysts have been doing to fight COVID. They’ve been creating amazing research, models and, of course, vaccines faster than anyone imagined. A few recent examples are the Terasaki Institute’s AI system to
detect COVID from a single lung scan (https://healthitanalytics.com/news/detecting-covid-19-with-artificial-intelligence-imaging-technology), the Mayo Clinic and nference’s NLP work to
predict COVID complications (https://healthitanalytics.com/news/natural-language-processing-helps-assess-covid-19-complications), and Andrew Barber & Jeremy West’s analysis that the Ohio’s vaccine lottery saved
over $60m in averted healthcare costs (https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/16/ohios-vaccine-lottery-saved-more-than-60m-in-averted-healthcare-costs).
If I say "dataset", you think of...
The Census. I find it fascinating that the oldest data projects in history trace back to governments and even kings wanting to create a better society (and collect taxes).
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
This is one of the rare technical fields where you studied doesn’t really matter, because no one really studied data science in school! The only thing that matters is learning and curiosity.

COVID threads
The Financial Times’ voice of rationality, data journalist John Burn-Murdoch, has published two brilliant Twitter threads about COVID. The
first (https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1447617110910382081)explains population statistics when things look odd (e.g. what “>100% of the population is vaccinated” actually means) and is ultimately about the perils of using data without fully appreciating the methodology that created/processed that data in the first place.

#445: quantum of sollazzo – 2 November 2021
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
I will give the next issue a miss due to travels, but you can expect a bit of a double whammy the week after next.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Sam Joiner
Sam (http://twitter.com/samjoiner)is Visual Stories Editor at the Financial Times
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
A new team combining data, design, coding and reporting skills, we're still finding our feet! But we want to have a track record of producing agenda-setting projects where visual elements play an essential role in communicating the story. In essence where the answer is shown, rather than told.
These projects will be published on a regular basis and use data and visuals to provide insightful answers to the key questions of the moment, rather than the day — an important distinction which affords us the time required to craft the impactful journalism we know FT subscribers value most.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Hard to pick just one, but as a keen cyclist I'll go for the
road safety project (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-safe-is-it-for-you-to-cycle-to-work-these-maps-will-show-you-xnvtwq6wz)I worked on at the Times. We combined three decades of data from the national accidents database with maps of Britain’s road network to pinpoint every accident involving a cyclist in the country since 1980.  
It allowed us to identify the most dangerous roads and manoeuvres for cyclists (drivers turning left) and led to a string of data-driven stories. The crown jewel was our route planner, which let readers enter a start and end point and see how many crashes there had been on their journey in the last year (as well as plot the safest route from A to B).
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
It's too easy to go for the NYT, but their recent project on the
Miami Condo Collapse (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/01/us/miami-building-collapse.html)is a fabulous example of what you can achieve when you combine traditional and contemporary reporting techniques. It combines forensic analysis with hugely impactful visual storytelling and is truly at the cutting edge of modern journalism. But the key takeaway was the amount of groundwork that went into analysing documents and speaking to experts. It's what separates the very best data-driven projects.  
And a slightly more left field example to balance that choice out — this piece on how
inferior women's jeans pockets are (https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/)by The Pudding is great. It's a nice example of a visual essay being superior to words alone, plus I love the fact the reporters went out and measured hundreds of pockets. Not all data stories start with a computer!
If I say "dataset", you think of...
...whether it's just a sheet with numbers in it or the starting point for a great story
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Pick a programming language and stick with it – even when it feels like you're going backwards the lightbulb moment will come if you keep at it!
Data is or data are...
I try to steer away from it! Data analysis shows, the dataset shows…

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
Many thanks to the brilliant folks at DataJournalism.com for adding "Quantum of Sollazzo" in their list of

Edafe Onerhime
Edafe (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekoner/)is Data Architecture Governance Lead & Executive Director at JPMorgan Chase.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My work has evolved from purely a technologist for 15 years, to focusing on helping organisations get sustainable value from data over the last 10 years. At JPMorgan Chase, I lead data governance in infrastructure. My audience are product owners and architects of various stripes. So I use a lot of their tooling - like MagicDraw for UML and Erwin for models. I also see the odd JSON snippet! Like many senior data leaders, I’m not in the weeds of development or coding, though I still need to understand the tooling, technology, and workflow.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Only one?! There are so many to choose from. I'm very proud of the
Open Standards for Data Guidebook (https://standards.theodi.org/)It's a unique resource I created for the
Open Data Institute (https://theodi.org/).
Data standards power collaboration (with data) at scale. A successful data standard may seem simple but there are many failures and abandoned standards. The guide helps anyone understand why, how, and what you need to be successful. You don't need to be a data person to take advantage of the lessons - it's written with policy makers, technologists, and business leaders in mind.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
The first that springs to mind is
Data Mesh (https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/data-mesh)conceived by
Zhamak Dehghani (https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhamak-dehghani/). It is less of a data project, and more of a data paradigm. I love that Zhamak has simplified the mess of data lake (or let's face it, data swamps!) architecture by standing on the shoulder of giants. Zhamak has re-imagined how data scientists, data analysts, and data architects get value from data using Domain-Driven Design or DDD. Data Mesh focuses on people and technology, which occupies the same space as data governance – so it resonates.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Set of data and venn diagrams (old school!) and then data files and finally, a logical encapsulation of data.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Data is not agnostic. It is designed, collected, curated, and interpreted by humans – or at least, the hand of humans is present in the process. It has changed societies and impacts lives. Which is why we as technologists must consider how we decolonise data for equity and all of humankind. Especially relevant in October and in Black History Month UK.
Data is or data are...
I’m agnostic! Whatever works?

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Florent Daudens
Florent (http://twitter.com/fdaudens)is News Director at Le Devoir.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
Datavisualization is one of the pillars of our editorial strategy, and we define it in two main tracks:
On a daily basis, to find visual leads in data or to put a story in context.
With bigger scale projects based on exclusive data or in-depth explainers.
We have a magical team of four people:
Laurianne Croteau (https://twitter.com/llcroteau),
Olivia Gélinas (https://twitter.com/oliviagelinas),
Antoine Noreau (https://twitter.com/@antonoro_), and
Sandrine Vieira (https://twitter.com/sandrinevieira7); a growth of 100% since we hired two people recently! It's an important commitment for our newsroom to develop our data visualization expertise. Moreover, we have built strong ties with Polytechnique Montréal, an engineering university, to enhance our R&D capacities.
I think it is also important to democratize data in the newsroom, and we are lucky to count on several journalists interested by datavisualization capacities and curious to use the tools we provide them!
For our daily production, we juggled with different tools, even homemade chart tools, but finally decided to adopt DataWrapper, since they were able to configure the layouts with our graphical guidelines (even for print) and its easy-of-use interface. With Google Sheets, it is our go-to toolset.
For bigger projects, we look to various tools such as Pandas, Plotly and D3.js, but also Mapbox for cartographic projects. And we always try to build scalable projects, in order to avoid to start from scratch each time.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Allow me to cheat a little bit, but it’s election time in Canada (aka Christmas for data journalists!), and even if it was called early, we were able to release a series of captivating data projects:
Live 2021 election results and maps (https://www.ledevoir.com/documents/special/21-09_resultats-elections-canada-2021/index.html)Compare parties promises (https://www.ledevoir.com/documents/special/2021-09-analyse-promesses-electorales/index.html)Where will the election be winned? (https://www.ledevoir.com/documents/special/2021-08-ou-se-joueront-elections/index.html)Draw yourself the Trudeau government’s record (https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/canada/625992/dessine-moi-un-bilan)Revisit the House of Commons after its dissolution (https://www.ledevoir.com/documents/special/2021-08-chambre-dissolution/index.html)...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Difficult to choose, but I especially liked this project from the Washington Post:
Where America’s developed areas are growing: ‘Way off into the horizon’ (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/land-development-urban-growth-maps). Sometimes, the map is the territory. This story takes interesting data released by the USGS and does a great job at explaining the causes of this development (housing costs, fracking boom, etc), and the environmental impacts of it.
Also, a great example of data without complicated visualizations is
this investigation of the NYT (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/22/upshot/hospital-prices.htm)showing different prices charged by hospitals to patients and insurers for the same basic services.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A potential gold mine / headache.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
It is not because you have big datasets that you have to expose them all to your readers and that it is interesting (I plead guilty on these two charges!). Sometimes, a 1-million-rows file will only give you one bar chart, and it can be ok. You really have to think about the informative value of your data, and how to explain your story in the most comprehensive way to your readers.

Donata Columbro
Donata (https://twitter.com/dontyna)is a cofounder of Dataninja, journalist, and data humanizer.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My daily work with data consists of reading newspapers, surfing Twitter and Instagram, looking for news that contains charts or numbers and collect them to a special bookmark folder I use when I prepare my training on how to understand data. I rarely produce data visualization myself, but instead I help people to improve their data literacy through online courses and Instagram videos where I talk passionately about the data culture we should all need to embrace. It doesn't mean to be "driven by data", but to "understand that data drives your life", so you need to become... their friend, or least aware that they are all around us.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I'm proud of my Instagram data literacy project
#tispiegoildato (https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tispiegoildato/). I started it in 2019, before the pandemic, as an educational project about how to read data and charts. It grew with many covid related questions from my followers, but I kept talking about other kind of news and data for more than a year, and now it has become a published book (
Ti spiego il dato (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ti-Spiego-Dato-Donata-Columbro/dp/8885546269)), Quinto Quarto ed. 2021). I am very thankful to my Instagram audience because I have learned so much from their doubts and questions, they really trained me on how to speak about data to the general public. I find that as data people we tend to consider our slang as universal and clear for anybody but...it's not :)...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Since I don't produce data projects but mainly talk and write about data, I wish I would have written
Data Feminism (https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism), a must read book by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein on how to change the practice of data science by being more inclusive, challenging our privileges and pursuing a data justice culture.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Boxes full of different kinds of everyday small objects I collect to count the days when I care about my mental health (candies = I went to therapy, leaves = I've done some meditation, ...). I only started a few weeks ago but it looks like a real dataset now.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Don't be afraid to ask for help or for advice, even if it means admitting you don't know something.

Social media platforms attempting to curb abuse and misinformation have been accused of political bias.
We deploy neutral social bots (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25738-6)who start following different news sources on Twitter, and track them to probe distinct biases emerging from platform mechanisms versus user interactions. We find no strong or consistent evidence of political bias in the news feed. Despite this, the news and information to which U.S. Twitter users are exposed depend strongly on the political leaning of their early connections.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
·
Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
David Dubas-Fisher
, the first sports data journalist to be featured in Quantum of Sollazzo’s Six Questions. If you read any Reach newspaper, such as the Daily Mirror, you’re likely to have seen his excellent dataviz work.
I haven’t posted about my day job for a bit. Last week, Hospital Times published a
nice article (https://www.hospitaltimes.co.uk/nhs-ai-lab-skunkworks-the-cautious-early-adopters/), based on a conversation I had with editor David Duffy, which captures well the approach, philosophy, and values of my AI Skunkworks team.
This week's issue is sponsored by The Prepared
This week,
The Prepared (https://theprepared.org/)features the
story of the Bay Model (https://theprepared.org/newsletter-archive/2021-12-06), a 1:1000 scale recreation of the SF Bay area hydrology, used in the 1950s to study the impacts of hydroelectric development.
Subscribe to The Prepared (https://theprepared.org/)for stories about physical engineering and how data lives in the real world.

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
David Dubas-Fisher
David (http://twitter.com/dubasfisher)is a Sport data journalist at the Reach Data Unit.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I use data to produce sport stories for Reach’s national and regional titles. A lot of sport data journalists focus on things like tactics and player performance, but I don’t have access to that data, so I focus on things like rising ticket prices, the number of racist incidents at matches, or club finances. That means a lot of searching the internet and manually entering data into Google Sheets. That’s my main tool for analysing data where I try to find as many interesting lines for our various titles as possible.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
The first one that springs to mind is our football finance gadget. It gives key financial information about each club in the top four divisions of English football over the last five seasons (for example, see
this article (https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/stoke-city-accounts-finances-ffp-4287338)). Before I started it though I had no idea how to read company accounts, and all of them are in PDF format and unsearchable. That meant I have to give myself a crash course in company accounts, and then manually search hundreds of PDFs and enter the data into a spreadsheet. The Data Unit’s designers and developers then created a gadget that can be inserted into any Reach story about football finances.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I remember seeing
a story in the Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/15/nine-mps-free-euro-2020-tickets-gambling-companies)a month or two ago about MPs taking Euro 2020 tickets from gambling firms and was kicking myself for not having done it. One of those rare times where sport reporters get to mix things up and do a bit of politics.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A lot of work heading my way.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
The data isn't the story. Don't write lots of words about percentage increases and what have you, people need to know the real-world implication of what the data is telling you
Data is or data are...
"Data is". I know data is technically a plural word, but people who insist on using it that way are just Grampa Simpson yelling at a cloud.

The Winners and Losers From a Year of Ranking Covid Resilience
As
this article (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-23/the-winners-and-losers-from-a-year-of-ranking-covid-resilience)‘s subheading rightly notes, “
past performance is no guarantee of future success – or failure
”. The team at Bloomberg has been working for over a year on their Covid Resilience Ranking, which tracks how good or bad different places have been doing during the pandemic.
Populism on Twitter might be a problem for the Labour Party
Another intriguing
analysis (https://danumbers.substack.com/p/populism-on-twitter-might-be-a-problem)by Italian data journalist Francesco Piccinelli, covering how populism is expressed in tweets by British MPs. It uses a custom definition of “populism” by the author, based on the NRC algorithm. All the R code used to conduct the analysis and generate the chart is available.

Another
academic paper (https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2105061118)this week.
Grim abstract excerpt: “
People frequently search the internet for information. Eight experiments (n = 1,917) provide evidence that when people Google for online information, they fail to accurately distinguish between knowledge stored internally—in their own memories—and knowledge stored externally—on the internet. […] As a result, people may lose sight of where their own knowledge ends and where the internet’s knowledge begins.

Spatial Analysis of Dog Ownership and Car Use in the UK
I love academics for coming up with
such ideas (https://findingspress.org/article/29846-spatial-analysis-of-dog-ownership-and-car-use-in-the-uk).
“
Walking the dog, and other dog-related practices, have been suggested to be particularly car-dependent. Secondary data analysis presented finds associations between the high energy use practices of car travel and dog ownership. There is a strong association between the rate of dog ownership and car km travelled per person. This relationship holds when controlling for income, level of urbanisation housing type and demographic variables.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or

Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Giorgia Lodi
a technologist for the Italian Research Council who was, when she was a PhD student, one of the best lecturers I've ever had throughout my academic life. I was incredibly happy to see we'd both ended up as Open Data activists!
·
'till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Giorgia Lodi
Giorgia (http://twitter.com/GiorgiaLodi)is a Technologist at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the Italian National Research Council.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I work on personal and open data, and, in general, knowledge representation using semantic web standards and technologies (e.g., OWL, RDF, SPARQL). The idea is to represent data with the highest level of data quality standards, so that data can be (re)used in complex applications/systems. I am currently involved in projects covering different domains, from fishery to procurement, to environment and health. The challenges are many but also recurrent: the same data of different organisations is organised in heterogeneous ways and with poor quality, which makes the task of integrating it and getting value difficult (because the value of data comes out when you start linking it with other data!).  
The tools I am used to working with are ontology and vocabulary editors (e.g., Protégé, VocBench), SPARQL endpoints to query data (e.g., GraphDB and Virtuoso), graphical tools for ontologies design (e.g., Graffoo), knowledge graph construction tools as RML but also software for Data Protection Impact Assessment as PIA when I support my colleagues at the Institute in dealing with the personal data processed in their research projects.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
This project about commercial fish names (https://fish-commercial-names.ec.europa.eu/fish-names/)that my group started some years ago with DG MARE.  
It is a traditional software system and it also probably appears simple, but the data management we do in the back end is quite complex, with strong data reconciliation issues we have targeted over years in order to collect, in one unique point of access, a variety of data coming from different data sources, including unstructured ones such as laws. You cannot imagine how many ways there are in the different EU Member States to simply publish a table with two columns “commercial designations” and “scientific names” of fishery products they market!
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
The
ArCo Project (https://dati.beniculturali.it/progetto-arco-architettura-della-conoscenza/)(ITA) which is a project of my group at the Institute carried out in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage; unfortunately, I do not follow its development in person. The project is about opening up data of the vast Italian cultural heritage according to the linked open data paradigm. On top of this knowledge graph, which is constantly growing and expanding, nice research work is currently on-going involving virtual reality, artificial intelligence, among others. In essence, the power of having nice and interoperable data, interconnected with each other using consolidated standards, is that you then can exploit that data to create innovative systems!
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Cleansing and a shared semantic model.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Try to do your best to curate data but remember that real systems, and the world, are not perfect: you will come to tolerate and manage some (hopefully low) level of “garbage” :-)Data is or data are...
Since I am Italian, data are, but it should be data is!

How Environmental Journalists Can Use NASA’s New Landsat 9 Satellite
NASA has recently launched its ninth Landsat satellite in 50 years.
This article (https://gijn.org/2021/11/30/how-environmental-journalists-can-use-nasas-new-landsat-9-satellite/)gives some tips on how to download and use its data.
To note: USGS, which runs the data programme for NASA, is considering switching to a paid-for model, so you better download what you can.
Which countries can you call?
Ok, this might be a bit niche for this newsletter, but it's a very interesting use of data. In ham radio, there is something called "Reverse Beacon Network" that uses data from international radio contacts to build a map of what places can "hear" one another. This is pretty useful to radio hams, because propagation is not a fixed quantity.
Chris Wraith, a technologist and my personal guide in the ham radio world, has created this handy

"
When statistics are understood as facts (https://zephoria.medium.com/statistical-imaginaries-an-ode-to-responsible-data-science-ac6ffcd8f246), the public expects exact knowledge. Precision. A census is supposed to be an enumeration of the public, a count of all the people. The Census Bureau produces numbers as facts, knowing full well that such a number is only the best number producible given the procedures the bureau uses. But just because the process worked does not mean that the result is as exact as the number implies.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.

Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Elisabeth Gamperl
, managing editor of the visual desk at the Süddeutsche Zeitung and member of its editorial innovations team. It's interview number 27. Soon to be a website somewhere? Any ideas in this respect are much welcome.
My
virtual keynote (https://www.youtube.com/watch)for CIVICA on how to run experimental AI projects in the NHS is now available online (17 minutes into the video, immediately after Timandra Harkness). And if you're interested in my day job, a case study on
how to use AI for better bed allocation in hospitals (https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/ai-lab/explore-all-resources/develop-ai/improving-hospital-bed-allocation-using-ai/), with source code openly available, has just been published by my team.

Speaking of jobs, a very interesting

data-driven not for profit that targets the market forces destroying nature ''[...] and does this by improving transparency and accountability.
" They are looking for a
researcher (https://globalcanopy.org/jobs/researcher/)who cares about their mission and is data-savvy.
And with that... Quantum of Sollazzo will now take a 3-week break over the festive period. I haven't taken a break in what feels ages (lockdowns might have contributed to producing content, I suppose). Have a great break, whatever you celebrate, and see you in 2022!

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Elisabeth Gamperl
Elisabeth (http://twitter.com/FrauGamperl)is managing editor of the visual desk at the Süddeutsche Zeitung and member of its editorial innovations team.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
As the managing editor of the newly formed visual desk (we started on october the 1st!), we are going to establish new workflows between the editorial and visual departments to create more engaging visual journalism. We are also constantly trying to find new ways to tell stories by using interactive tools and multiple forms of media.  

I am also part of the editorial innovations team where we are continuously improving an in-house content managing system which makes it easier for our journalists to use multimedia in their stories. It is very exciting to work with coders and designers on a product. We experiment with new technical possibilities and if it is useful for the whole newsroom, we implement it in our cms.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
The story I would like to mention here is a
collaboration between our data team and our interdisciplinary team (https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/artikel/wissen/pandemie-zwei-millionen-schicksale-e980201/). The pandemic reached its painful peak  in early 2021. We wanted to build a digital monument for the victims of the pandemic. Each silhouette in the story represents a person who died of Corona. By the time you get to the end of the story, you've encountered nearly two million silhouettes.  

We’ve interwoven individual fates with the key dates and events of the first year of the pandemic. While highlights of the crisis appear in the foreground, a counter for each data point shows how many died at that time.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I am a huge fan of gamification. Therefore, I really enjoyed
this emotion-recognition interactive (https://ig.ft.com/emotion-recognition/)from the Financial Times.  

The team tested a technology that tracks facial expressions. The user is part of the story. I also love the navigation: you feel like you are in an insta story.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Experiments! 3D modelling, graphic animation, data-fed audio.. There are so many ways to present datasets in an exciting way.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Learn the basics of UX design. It helps thinking in a user-centered way and you will find new angles for your stories.
Data is or data are...
Definitely “data are”. In digital journalism it should always be plural, because it is always teamwork.

#452: quantum of sollazzo – 11 January 2022
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) Happy New Year!
This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
This is the traditional post-festive double-whammy newsletter. Enjoy it!
·
Every week I include a six-question interview with an inspiring data person. This week, I speak with
Lisa Hornung
, Data Insights Lead at Vivacity Labs.
Meanwhile, a former interviewee, Lisa Charlotte Muth of Datawrapper, is
writing a book about the use of colour in data visualization (https://blog.datawrapper.de/book-about-colors-in-data-vis/), something that will certainly interest some of you.
Speaking of the interviews, here’s some news: I’ll soon be launching the
Six Questions archive
as a webpage. Watch this space.

What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
The type of data and tools I work with usually varies by project. If I have to deal with lots of data or advanced analysis is needed, I do most of the data cleaning and analysis in python, but sometimes Excel is the better choice. For example, when it’s a one off project or colleagues with no coding experience are involved. The visualisation tool and outputs also vary by project. For dashboards I use Google Data Studio or Tableau, Datawrapper for quick interactive charts (and maps), Excel for static reports, QGIS for custom maps and Illustrator for highly customised visuals.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
When I was managing the
UK Civil Society Almanac (https://beta.ncvo.org.uk/ncvo-publications/uk-civil-society-almanac-2021/), an annual statistical publication on UK charities, I led a redesign project to improve the way we communicate findings. Based on user research we changed the structure of the report and offered further data downloads. It doesn’t feel super innovative today but I was very pleased when we launched with a new website and improved data visualisations in 2019. And it was great to see how our data was used to inform a Covid-19 emergency funding package of charities in 2020.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Oh there are so many, but I really admire when people create useful tools for the community. For example, my former colleague David Kane built a number of tools like
FindThatPostcode (https://findthatpostcode.uk/)or
FindThatCharity (https://findthatcharity.uk/)to help make official datasets more accessible. Another more creative tool I really like is
Plotparade (https://plotparade.com/index.html)by Krisztina Szűcs.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A table – even though I work with all sorts of data these days (e.g. geo data, webpages, text), I still think of data mostly as a table.
Yay, new things to discover – a new dataset is always super exciting and fun to explore.
Hopefully the data collection person knew what they were doing – while exciting, new data often means messy data and lots of cleaning before you actually get to the more interesting parts.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Working in data means you’re constantly learning. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming when you are a data analyst (engineer, scientist, visualisation designer, …) because there are so many different tools (and techniques) out there and the field is always evolving. When I get frustrated or feel like an imposter, I try to remember that it’s all about the ride. That way I can enjoy learning new things and take it as a positive challenge rather than focus too much on the outcome. Reading about
other people’s experience (https://nightingaledvs.com/draw-the-rest-of-the-chart/)in this area is helpful too.
Data is or data are...
Definitely is! It just sounds better.

All good with crypto until someone randomly finds it (ok, it’s close to impossible given the size of the search space, but…)A wave of words
“
The coronavirus era has a vocabulary all its own: brand-new coinages, jargon we suddenly all know, and everyday words with new meanings. Over the past two years, these linguistic developments have seemed to echo the course of the pandemic itself. The first weeks of “flattening the curve” gave way to a spring of “anti-mask” and “remote work”; this summer was more about “variant” and “vaccination.”

#453: quantum of sollazzo – 18 January 2020
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
I've recently published a Medium

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Maurizio Napolitano
Maurizio (https://twitter.com/napo)is Head of the Digital Commons Lab unit at FBK (Fondazione Bruno Kessler – Bruno Kessler Foundation) in Trento, Italy
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My working days are similar to those of a pinball ball bouncing between meetings where we talk about data (on staff descriptions, on skills acquired by students, on mobility), where I have to turn these meetings into documents, where I have to organise lesson for my teaching activities, and - the most important moment. relaxing - when I can process data. Creating maps and processing data is a moment of fun for me. (I also have another activity: volleyball coaching ... but this is another story).
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
These moments of relaxation then lead me to share the results that then have their own small media effect such as the stress map for those who ride a
bicycle on Italian roads (https://bicistressatedaltraffico.it/#5/42.98/12.79), or that of
the width of the sidewalks (http://sidewalkwidths.it/#8/41.458/12.706)or the
distances 30km traveled (https://napo.github.io/pat30cappa/)from the borders of the municipalities of the province where I live,  the maps that allow you to see the
evolution of my city over time (https://trento.timetravelmaps.it/)and more.
An activity that is taking my time at the moment, but which at the same time loads me, is organizing the lessons of the geospatial analysis course for data science students at the University of Trento.
The course is here
https://napo.github.io/geospatial_course_unitn/ (https://napo.github.io/geospatial_course_unitn/)It is a very "hands-on" course: I explain geospatial concepts, and immediately show in practice how they are applied using python notebooks. The lessons are every Friday, and ,at the end of each lesson I propose an exercise where, on the next lesson I present my solutions and I add new concepts.
It amuses me .. even if it takes away a lot of energy.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
I admit that many of the projects I have built and mentioned above are inspired by the work of others.
I often observe, fall in love with the project, and reinterpret it using data closer to me and sometimes reinvent something new.
I observe with pleasure everything that passes around the OpenStreetMap world and I am fascinated by the projects of
Stamen (https://stamen.com/),
Mapbox (https://mapbox.com/),
Development Seed (https://developmentseed.org/),
GIScience Research Group of the University of Heidelberg (http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/)... spaces that I am passionate about and with which I would very much like to find a way to collaborate ...
Then there are the friends, those you collaborate with, whom you look at with admiration, the passion with which you compare yourself and with whom you collaborate occasionally.
Among these I mention the work of
Sheldon Studio (https://sheldon.studio/)by Matteo Moretti and the Quantum of Sollazzo newsletter :)If I say "dataset", you think of...
If you say "dataset", I start with three questions:
what does it contain?
with what license is it distributed?
can I start playing it?
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
The most fascinating part of the data is its representation, but to get there you must first learn how to collect it, clean it, sort it, integrate it ... all boring things ...
The advice therefore is to start from the most fascinating part: to understand how to represent them and then go deeper and deeper into the question.
By doing the path in reverse (= from representation to collection) you will only increase your motivation more and more and go very very far.
Data is or data are...
I don't know English well but I have been told that "data" is the plural of "datum" (Latin word). When I write in English I use "data is ...", when I speak instead I bounce between a "data is ..." to "data are ...". This is because in Italian we say "dati" which is the plural of "dato".
In conclusion: I make a big mess ... but ... I have a lot of good friends ready to help me. But I am sure of one thing: in Italian I always try to use the word "dati" otherwise someone might think that I am talking about calendars (in italian "data" means "date").

The Economist on Quadratic Voting
Quadratic Voting is a form of voting in which voters can also express a strength for their vote, so for example one could vote for a party but also say that they like that party 7 out of 10. The idea is that each voter can be allocated a number of credits that can be used in multiple ways.
The Economist has a good
explainer (https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/the-mathematical-method-that-could-offer-a-fairer-way-to-vote)alongside a
real-life example (https://www.economist.com/interactives/2021/12/18/quadratic-voting)in which they're asking readers to vote for a variety of themes, with the outcomes presented in a future article.

Alarmingly, the system could also be used to help identify and track people who think their online behavior is anonymous.

It's because data journalists are the community where I found a quasi-total overlap with the 3 areas of data I love: a geeky curiosity in learning something through data;  using storytelling as the main way to communicate your findings; and a willingness to break the boundaries of technology through multiple forms of media or approaches. I miss attending Hacks/Hackers in person, by the way.

Six questions to...
Erin Davis
Erin (http://twitter.com/Erindataviz)is Data Visualization Specialist, at 1point21 Interactive
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
I create data-driven content for the firm’s clients, mostly attorneys. We want to make pieces that are interesting to the general public but still in line with the clients’ areas of practice, which can be a bit challenging!
I rely heavily on public datasets, especially of car crashes, crimes, and injuries. Most of my data collection, cleaning, analysis, viz, etc is done in R. Quite a lot of my work is geospatial in nature, so I also use QGIS a ton.
Once I produce a visualization with R/QGIS, I add on the text (headers, citations, annotations) in Photoshop.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I had a lot of fun with a recent work project–I did a silly
>study to see whether wrapping or unwrapping presents causes more injuries (https://safer-america.com/christmas-gift-wrapping-injuries/). (Spoiler: depends on who you are).
Personal project-wise, I’m very excited about
these maps (https://erdavis.com/2021/11/02/when-will-the-heat-break/). I parsed about 280GB data to make them, and I’m pleased I managed to do it!
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
There are SO many of these. There’s nothing like the “man, I wish I’d thought of that” feeling. My Twitter bookmarks is basically just a hall of things I wish I’d created myself!
Some that come to mind are:
Coordinates of photos taken from the ISS (https://twitter.com/sasha_trub/status/1466961926441914372)Only the punctuation of novels (https://medium.com/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4#.cx4yrsrnv)Renaissance Florence vs. an Atlanta interchange (https://twitter.com/stevemouzon/status/1419013637780426757)The most beautiful map about fish (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-brexit-eu-fisheries/)If I say "dataset", you think of...
The thrill of new data! I hoard datasets like a dragon. Give me mooooore.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
It is very easy to get too close to a dataset. I’ve definitely made the mistake of producing graphics that I thought were simple and easy to understand but were actually confusing to newcomers. I only thought they were clear because I was intimately familiar with the data. If you can, it’s great practice to get other eyes on your work or to set it aside for a while and come back to it fresh
Data is or data are...
Data is. Fight me.

Machine Learning Coding: Essential algorithms, mathematical foundations and best practices

Here's an excerpt from the abstract: "
However, there is no such thing as Machine Learning without a good deal of coding. Despite the large overlap in background knowledge of mathematics, statistics, software engineering and a generic ability in problem-solving, there is quite a bit of difference between more research- and product-oriented flavours of ML. While the former is mostly focused on creating new state-of-the-art models and new ways of training, the latter’s main concern is to make it work in real life. At times, trade-offs have to be found, with a specific constraint on keeping systems efficient both in terms of uptime and speed of execution. This can hardly be obtained by only using off-the-shelf solutions. The book also represents a unique resource to prepare a job interview for Machine Learning engineering positions.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
Last week, I was interviewed by Rory Cellan-Jones, who until recently was the BBC's Technology Correspondent, on the work I'm leading in the NHS AI Lab Skunkworks. His write-up can be found in
his newsletter "Always On" (https://rorycellanjones.substack.com/p/giuseppe-sollazzo-can-the-nhs-do), and you can also listen to the recording of the interview
on his podcast (https://www.buzzsprout.com/1919307/9963934). I entirely stand by this excerpt, which captures the reason why I do what I do:

Six questions to...
Sonja Kuijpers
Sonja ()is a data illustrator, at her independent STUDIO TERP
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
When working for clients I mainly handle smaller datasets that I scrutinize in Excel, then create some basic graphs with that and/or RAWGraphs.io and export to Adobe Illustrator to elaborate and bring in design-aesthetics. I also create self-initiated projects where I often gather and harvest the data myself. I always try to experiment with shapes, colours, and layout. As well as bringing insight, I really like my work to be visually appealing.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I truly loved working on the
Bayreuther Festspiele (http://www.studioterp.nl/datavisualization-bayreuther-festspiele-faz/)project. It got to create 3 pages full of data visualization for the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Zeitung. From the family tree of Wagner to a visualization of a fight in one of the operas.
Of course, I am also still proud (although the wording doesn’t feel quite correct here) of my self-initiated
A View On Despair (http://www.studioterp.nl/a-view-on-despair-a-datavisualization-project-by-studio-terp/), which was a very personal project on suicide numbers. I won an Information is Beautiful Award with it, which I felt very honoured for.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
Hard question. So many great out there. One that always keeps coming back to mind is
this one (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/microplastics-impact-on-fish-shown-in-pictures)from National Geographic (Alberto Luca López; Ryan T. Williams and Clare Trainor, also on
Information Is Beautiful (https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/4192-plastic-profusion)) on Plastic profusion. I like the choice for straws to represent the data on microplastics, but what I truly like is the layout, the bars folding around the page when there’s not enough space to hold these large numbers. I think it is such a great way to show great disparities and still be able to ‘read’ the visual and I am still looking for a project where I can incorporate this as well.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
All the elements and actions you can see, taste, hear, touch, smell around you.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
To not get overwhelmed with all the options and tools. Especially when like me coming from another field. If you already own one skill, see how you can work with that.
Data is or data are...

Six questions to...
Taylor Johnston
Taylor (http://twitter.com/TF_Johnston)is a Fellow at The New York Time Graphics Department
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
As a member of the graphics desk at The New York Times, I work with data and design maps, charts and other types of visualizations for breaking news and enterprise stories. When performing data analysis, I use a combination of Google Sheets and RStudio. Then when designing, depending on the visualization I am trying to create, I use ai2html for static charts and infographics, QGIS for mapmaking and Svelte.js for building web applications.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
When I was the data and interactives intern at The Dallas Morning News during the summer of 2019, I produced
a project on the inequity in Dallas’ public pools (https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2019/08/31/as-dallas-revives-public-pools-some-neighborhoods-are-left-behind/)using data analysis and visualization.
We found that as the city began to renovate public pools, it widened disparities. Pools in mostly white, affluent communities were chosen to receive upgrades, while pools in primarily Black and Latino, lower-income communities were less likely to be revamped.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
There are so many projects that I come across on a weekly basis and store away in my trove of data viz bookmarks… but I think one of my all time favorites is Nadieh Bremer’s
“Why do cats & dogs…?” (https://whydocatsanddogs.com/)I love the style of this piece and how fun it is! It brings together design and data viz so wonderfully.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Jeremy Singer-Vine’s newsletter
“Data is Plural” (https://www.data-is-plural.com/)... a newsletter I often scroll through when I am seeking inspiration!
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Try to find one specific skill or tool you want to master, and focus on that. When you feel comfortable, move on to the next. When I was first starting out I was so overwhelmed by trying to learn everything that others in this field were using to do their jobs. There’s so many tools out there and it’s nice to be familiar with them but take each one step at a time!

This chart (https://observablehq.com/@chrisjkuch/covid-hotspots)shows the daily number of new Covid-19 infections in each state over time. The y-axis is the population-normalized number of new infections per day; the x-axis is the rate of transmission (Rt). Each dot is a state or territory of the US, colored by region, and the area of the dot is proportional to the estimated number of new Covid-19 infections on that day in that state.

Six questions to...
David Kane
David (http://twitter.com/kanedr)is a freelance researcher
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
A lot of my work is looking at data about charities and other non-profits, so my typical day would start with firing up a Jupyter notebook and running some queries about a particular set of charities, or merging some datasets together to produce analysis.
More often than not I’ll be working with the Charity Commission’s register of charities. I run a site called
findthatcharity.uk (https://findthatcharity.uk)which has a big database full of lots of data about charities - that database is often where I start with a piece of work.
I have VSCode open most of the day, it’s where I run notebooks and write Python scripts to process data. I’m not sure what I’d do without the Pandas data analysis library in Python.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
I work a lot with 360Giving, an amazing charity that supports organisations to openly publish grants data, and helps people to use it to improve charitable giving.
This became even more important during the pandemic. To help people understand more about how funders responded to the crisis, in December we released a
piece of research looking at grants made since March 2020 (https://covidresearch.threesixtygiving.org/), and how funders made sure that the charities they supported could continue to provide vital services.
It was a real team effort - the team at 360Giving worked with a wide variety of funders to help them publish high quality data quickly - sometimes for the first time.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
My degree was Geography and I’ll always be a geographer at heart, so basically anything that Alasdair Rae does. I particularly love his work using 3D modelling software to make beautiful maps - eg
these maps of Australia (https://twitter.com/undertheraedar/status/1487881094154358788), or
using lidar to make 3D models of Scotland (https://twitter.com/undertheraedar/status/1484074215322140672/photo/1).
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Let’s get stuck in! What do I already know that I can link this to, to add extra context or make it more useful?
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
Always look at your data. It’s amazing how easy it is, especially when you use something like Python or R, to go straight to analysis or attempt to clean the data without seeing what’s actually in it first. Excel has lots of flaws, but the best thing about it is that the data is always there right in front of you - so you can see patterns & oddities. So even if I’m not using Excel I try to make sure I’m looking at the actual data as much as I can.
Data is or data are...
Data is. It's a mass noun - like water. There's not really such a thing as a "datum", a single point of data that exists in isolation - it's the context and integration with other parts that turns a number or a piece of text into "data". So you can only ever refer to the whole thing. Or something.

Six questions to...
Keila Guimarães
Keila (https://twitter.com/keilacguimaraes)is Data Lead, Google, on assignment from Vaco
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
Through my employment with Vaco, I work as a Data Lead for the global Trends team at Google, where I surface insights for newsrooms about what people search for on the internet. Prior to my transfer to London, I was a data curator with the same Google team, working in São Paulo, Brazil.
A big part of my everyday job is to help reporters find hidden stories in this huge database called Google Trends. These stories can be anything from people’s quick response to breaking news to mapping deeper shifts in behaviour.
I use a variety of data tools in my day to day work, from R scripts for cleaning and wrangling large portions of data to query language for interrogating our datasets.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
Back in March 2021, when Brazil was the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, I assisted one of the country’s main publications, Revista Piauí, to
map (https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/sem-frescura-ou-mimimi-as-buscas-por-socorro-contra-covid/)how searches for Covid-19 symptoms spiked ahead of a surge in cases in various Brazilian states. We
plotted (https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/5385843/)the curve of cases against the curve of searches for symptoms such as loss of taste, loss of smell and difficulty breathing. The
pattern (https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/5460206/)was striking throughout the pandemic.
We also assisted the newsroom
mapping (https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/no-consultorio-do-doutor-google-um-pais-sufocado-pela-covid-19/)the deeper impact of the pandemic in the wellbeing of Brazilians, looking into searches for mental health, economic hardship and overall physical pain. While at the epicentre of Covid-19 at the time, Brazil was also the epicentre for various search terms related to mental health and physical discomfort.  Discovering these correlations was very interesting.
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
At the moment I am following the
Suisse secret (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suisse_secrets)project, a large investigation into the Swiss banking system. The series of stories unmasks how clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering and other serious crimes were allowed to hold their money in Credit Suisse. Coordinated by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, it has taken 160 journalists from 48 news organisations – including
The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-unmasks-criminals-fraudsters-corrupt-politicians),
The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/credit-suisse-leak-swiss-bank.html)) and
Le Monde (https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2022/02/20/credit-suisse-les-millions-occultes-d-un-blanchisseur-presume-de-la-mafia-calabraise_6114531_4355770.html)– months to dig into the leaked data of more than 30,000 clients, which, collectively, hold more than $100 billion in the bank. Similar to recent large-scale investigations, such as the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers, the Suisse secrets is a fresh example of how blurred the lines between data and traditional journalism have become. Even though the data isn’t explicitly visible at first glance, it would be impossible to report on this without the desire and ability to analyse vast quantities of data. This story shows the power of digging into large, secret datasets, helping to reveal wrongdoing and keeping the powerful accountable.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
A source like any other, which needs to be researched, interviewed, challenged and seen in the perspective of a wider context. Similar to other sources, it also requires a good dose of scepticism.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
If I could talk to my younger self, I would remind her that the tools we use to explore and visualise data are enablers to good stories, not the main journey. Our data skills should be seen in the context of facilitators of storytelling, without dogmas. There is something sexy about saying you work with data, something only performed by the few, and for a long time I wasn’t sure if I was using the right tools to be considered part of this tight-knit club. But I wish I had learned early on that, in data journalism, data skills without a headline is fruitless and the story is the ultimate goal.
Data is or data are...
Data is. I just wouldn’t be able to say it differently!

animated dataviz (https://twitter.com/myGridGB/status/1495296773325262849)which is a good opportunity to remind you of the existence of the brilliant
electricitymap.org/ (https://electricitymap.org/), which is the source for the chart.

To be taken with a pinch of salt, as the misconfigured Google Map is not a great sign, but
this map (https://www.gfsis.org/maps/russian-military-forces)by the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies could be useful to understand the current war. Conversely, it might be a good starting point for a discussion about trust and information.

increased
accident rate caused by sudden braking?

#460: quantum of sollazzo – 22 March 2022
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I’ve been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you’re welcome to become a friend via the links below.
I’ve been away for three weeks, in part to do an 8-day long road trip of Andalusia which was amazing: beautiful scenery, way too much food, hikes in between the terrific and the terrifying (check out the
Caminito del Rey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caminito_del_Rey)), and catching up with friends who moved there and who I hadn’t seen in ages. So this week’s newsletter is a bit longer because so much has happened in data journalism over the past few weeks, sadly mostly related to the war in Ukraine.
·
This week marks the beginning of series 3 of my “Six Questions”, a collection of short standard interviews in which I hear from someone who works with data. In the 34 interviews published so far we’ve learned from data journalists, designers, analysts, policy analysts, and scientists. This week, we meet
Lesley-Anne Kelly
, the Data Content Lead of the recently formed data team at DC Thomson, the media company  that runs a number of popular publications in Scotland.
·
Before I close – you might remember that some time back I created some
road-colouring maps of London
that show roads coloured according to their suffix, i.e. whether they are
roads, streets, avenues, ways
, and so on. They sold really well, and I have only 5 left. I need to empty my loft so…
here’s a70% discountwhich basically will get you the map for a fiver (https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Puntofisso).
‘till next week,
Giuseppe
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)Six questions to...
Lesley-Anne Kelley
Lesley-Anne (http://twitter.com/L_A_Kelly)is the Data Content Lead of the recently formed data team at DC Thomson
.
What is your daily data work like and what tools do you use?
My team works on a mix of our own content whilst also supporting the wider newsroom. This gives us a wide variety of subjects to work on every day ranging from the ever present coronavirus to sport.
I prefer to work in R whenever I can but I also spend a decent amount of time arguing with Excel and Google sheets and our visualisation is done in Flourish. I’ve recently started to learn more about Github Actions which opened up a massive door to automation in newsrooms and I’ll be continuing to tinker with that in the near future.
Tell me about a data project that you're proud of...
We have a saying in the data team which is “NYT dreams on a DCT budget”. Based on that thing we all do of seeing a fantastic NYT data project and being down on yourself that you couldn’t ever do the same… and then you get to the bottom of the project and the byline runs into double digits. We are a three woman team and don’t have the resources of the big guys but we try to bring some of their ideas to our local audience. An example of that was
our project that took 11,000 local WW1 roll of honour records and geocoded them (https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/courier-investigations/2703714/dundee-ww1-victims/), mapped them out, and created a scrollytelling article that we hope told some of the stories behind the data.
We are also due to publish a series of stories based on my absolute favourite data of all time – Scottish baby names – very soon. I will die on the hill that you can learn more about trends in a country by looking at what people name their children than you can from just about any other dataset. It also really signifies one of the things that I feel really passionately about which is that data journalism can be fun and shouldn’t just be reserved for the serious subjects. This seems to me to be a hangover from data teams often being lumped in with investigations teams – generally because newsrooms weren’t really sure where to put them…
...and a data project that someone else did and you're jealous of.
As a regular reader of this newsletter I know that everyone and their mother talks about
the Pudding article about women’s pockets (https://pudding.cool/2021/07/rickrolling/)– and for good reason as it is incredible. I’ll expand on that and say essentially everything the Pudding has ever done (I want to be them when I grow up) but if I had to choose one (other than the aforementioned pockets article) I’d have to go for their story on the history of rickrolling.
If I say "dataset", you think of...
Oooh gimme. No really though, a dataset is just a source and data journalism is just interviewing that source. The fact that the sources tend to not talk back is a bonus though.
Give someone new to data a tip or lesson you wish you'd learned earlier.
If you have any repetitive data task at all it’s in your interest to learn to code. R, python, SQL – whichever you feel most comfortable with. I would not have made it through 2020 if I hadn’t got serious about learning R when that whole pandemic thing kicked off.
Data is or data are...
I know the technically correct answer is ‘data are’ but if I’m in casual conversation my brain is going to say ‘is’. I need to be re-programmed.
