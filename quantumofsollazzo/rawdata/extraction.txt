The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.

I am excited to announce I'll be a
judge for this year's Information is Beautiful Awards
- a celebration of global excellence in data visualization, something that this newsletter has covered for almost a decade. Stay tuned for the Longlist announcement on March 10th! You can also meet all the judges
here (https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/news/640-meet-the-2024-judges).

The most clicked link last week was
SQLNoir (http://sqlnoir.com), an interesting way to learn SQL by solving a crime with queries.
Also, a quick correction: last issues missed the link to the EDJNet's article about solar energy in Europe. Here it is:
Solar energy in Europe’s countryside: huge potential, complex challenges (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/solar-energy-in-europes-countryside-huge-potential-complex-challenges/).

On Thursday, 20 March, Connected by Data are running an unconference:
Engaging people on data and AI: giving people and communities a powerful say on public sector technologies (https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-03-20-unconference). It's in London - travel assistance available - and is part of
a wider project on public involvement in data and AI (https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-mohn-westlake), including their online
community of practice (https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2024-community-of-practice)(next one of those is
12 March (https://connectedbydata.org/events/2025-03-12-community-of-practice)).
✨ Topical
Most U.S. counties have little to no local news sources
Sara Fischer (Axios): "
An uptick in newspaper closures this year has left more than half of the nation's 3,143 counties — or 55 million people — with just
one or no local news sources (https://www.axios.com/2024/10/24/most-us-counties-have-little-to-no-local-news-sources)where they live.
"
Europe is short of General Practitioners
Adrian Burtin for Voxeurop/EDJNet: "
Europe is facing a
shortage of doctors (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/europe-is-short-of-gps/), across all specialisations. The deficit of general practitioners is a particular problem. Family doctors are ageing and unevenly distributed, and their profession is struggling to attract new recruits.
"
For comparison, you can find some data about England
here (https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/chart-of-the-week-which-areas-of-england-have-the-highest-number-of-patients-per-gp).
What is the current inflation rate in the US?
Historically (https://usafacts.org/answers/what-is-the-current-inflation-rate/country/united-states)speaking, it's not that bad. The 1920s were absolutely terrifying. USAFacts reports. Also, look at their other
article (https://usafacts.org/articles/why-might-prices-feel-high-if-inflation-is-slowing)on the same topic.
No, 150-Year-Olds Aren’t Collecting Social Security Benefits
David Gilbert, for Wired: "
Elon Musk claims to have found rampant fraud in the Social Security Administration. There’s a much simpler
explanation (https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/).
"
TL;DR: COBOL. It's interesting to understand the impact of legacy software in this hotly debated issue.

Rising rents across major European cities (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/europes-rents-are-on-the-rise-whos-hardest-hit/)are creating a housing crisis, disproportionately affecting low-income earners and those in unstable employment. Contributing factors include tourism, migration, low housing supply, and gentrification. Our investigation, led by EUrologus, highlights the need for policy changes to address these issues and ensure affordable housing for all.

Geocoding at scale
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)In our final installment in our series about using open data for geocoding we contemplate the challenges of geocoding at scale. What are the issues you face when you have many hundreds of thousands or even millions of coordinates or addresses to work on daily? At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we serve numerous customers in this category, and a common question that comes up is whether an API based solution can handle that type of scale.
An API-based solution, managed by experts, is almost always the most reliable and most affordable way to develop such an on-going system, as otherwise you will soon be spending a lot of valuable developer time making sure your geodata is staying current. As anyone who has worked with software can confirm: “
Building is easy, maintaining is hard
”.
Nevertheless, there are challenges that come with depending on any external service, one of course being network availability. At OpenCage we have multiple, fully-redundant data centers, and the availability of our service is independently and publicly monitored by a third party (current and past operational status can be seen at
status.opencagedata.com (https://status.opencagedata.com/)).
Still, even with a highly-available service, some customers worry about the “cost” of crossing the internet to an external service. The fastest API query is the one you don’t even make; a smart caching strategy can go a long way to reducing usage. Because our geocoding API is built on open data you can cache the results as long as you like, and we’ve
published a few tips and points to consider (https://opencagedata.com/api).
We hope you’ve enjoyed our series on the issues around geocoding with open data. While we’ve used our service as the example, we believe many of the concepts and considerations will apply regardless of the data processing tools and services you are building on. If you have questions regarding anything we discussed,
please get in touch (https://opencagedata.com/contact).
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

In the past, authors may have had to rely on hand-drawn maps or simple digital illustrations.

I have a project for work where the goal is to compare two non-randomized groups. One group received an experimental intervention, and we’d like to compare those folks to their peers who were not offered that same intervention. We have easy access to data from folks from the broader population during the same time period, so the goal isn’t so bad as far as quasi-experiments go.1 The team would like to improve the comparisons by using matching, and we have some missing data issues in the matching covariate set. I haven’t done an analysis quite like this before, so this post is a walk-through of the basic statistical procedure as I see it.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.

The most clicked link last week was the aptly named
Data Viz Project by Ferdio (https://datavizproject.com/).

Geomob (https://thegeomob.com/), co-host of
the Geomob podcast (https://thegeomob.com/podcast/), and co-founder of the
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/), has offered to introduce a set of points around the topic of geocoding. His first entry starts a few paragraphs below on why geocoding is just the first step.
·
It's AMA o'clock! This is the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Here's a few questions and answers you asked me over the past month.
Jessica Nichols asks "
What was your most memorable data related
thing
from 2024?
".
One must surely be the advances we've witnesses in LLMs and the impact they're having on services, the future of work, and the value, or perceived value, of companies. The latter point is particularly hot, just look at the chart of the NVIDIA stock value below. Throughout 2024, NVIDIA more than doubled its value thanks to its perceived value increasing due to progress in tools like ChatGPT and other Western world based AI companies that create LLMs that are trained using NVIDIA chips; however, in early 2025, it very quickly lost over 20% because of news from China, where DeepSeek seems to have released models that can be trained much more cheaply, and using hardware than is cheaper to source than that produced by NVIDIA. The impact of these fluctuations on society, investments, pension funds, etc, is huge. The thing about it is that the value produced by these impact is not easy to determine, and often doesn't translate to profitability.
But I also have to say that I've been trying some of these tools and they are indeed a massive productivity injection. The one I've worked the most is Anthropic's Claude, which I've used as a pair programming buddy. While it often doesn't get everything right, you can conversationally reason about code, add tests, debug, seek alternatives. While I still don't think you can use the code it produces straight out of the box, I must recognise that it's making my coding more solid more quickly. It does feel like pair programming with someone who's oddly both less experienced on broader issues, but also pretty good at hands on wrangling.
Asun says "
I'm in my late forties, doing an MA in data science -- my background is computational linguistics -- because I thought it would be interesting work and I would learn useful tools (and so far, I was right). I would like to work on a freelance basis rather than as a company employee -- possibly together with other sources of income, at least to begin with.
I plan on working on my own projects and will continue to learn (always), but I would be very grateful for any advice you could give me
."
Well, I'm not sure I can give more advice than what Asun is already doing pretty well: learn something you enjoy, see the connections with other areas of practice, offer them whenever you see a "you-shaped" hole. If you can afford financially to sacrifice a few days a month to self-development by creating your own projects, that will work out pretty well over time. When, in 2011, I created
LiveRugby (https://liverugbyapp.puntofisso.net/), I thought it would be a hit and I'd make a regular income out of it. Not just I made no money at all – if anything, I lost some! But it set me on a course to use what I learned to create other sources of data-driven income (and, in a way, I wouldn't be in my current job if I hadn't tried launching that app). My only advice is: aim for the star, but accept that failure is part of the journey. Ask yourself: what could be the value of doing this, if it fails? If you have an answer, keep doing it.
Stefano Gatti (author of this
splendid newsletter (https://stefanogatti.substack.com/)) asks "
What's your opinion on Open Data movement in Uk, in Europe and in USA? I'd like in particular to know your point of view about the impact on society and business.
"
We could write a book together about this, Stefano. The Open Data movement became mainstream at a time of political and societal change sweeping through the world, after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the global financial crisis had shown two major points: first, the value of transparency in helping challenge and scrutinise power; second, the power of data and technology in understanding a problem and taking action towards it. Has it had impact? Some, for sure. For example, in the UK, we have some
excellent monitoring of river levels thanks to open data (https://www.gaugemap.co.uk/). But I think that open data was, in many ways, a disappointing revolution. This is in part because we, as activists, didn't manage to truly win the argument of embedding data and open data into processes (well, I'm working on this in Government now, but in my case this is hardly open data as it's centred on individual-level data). But an important part of that disappointment stems from the fact societal problems are becoming more difficult, more global, changing more frequently – data is equally growing, becoming more complex, harder to process without infrastructure. Yes, we can access satellite imagery to monitor fires in California; but not everyone has the ability and capability to process data like this at home, it's not like an Excel spreadsheet to check where grant funding is going (important, but with a much lower barrier). This means that the ideal of dumping a dataset on a portal and expecting civic society to help is harder to achieve.
However, the positive impact of Open Data as a movement is how it allowed people to consider that more collaboration, communication, engagement, and evidence-driven processes, can create better outcomes. I always quote the
words of former Permanent Secretary Clare Moriarty (https://www.fda.org.uk/news/clare-moriarty-women-into-leadership-speech/): "
It started with a commitment to open data which led to us releasing 10,000 data sets in a year, including some truly massive ones. But opening our data was at most half the issue. More important was the effect it had on open working among colleagues across many organisations in the Defra group, and with a range of external partners from universities to charities to commercial organisations.
That led to interesting discussions about how open government relates to accountability, and also to user-centred design. It took us into how we can be more open as individuals, sharing a bit more about ourselves as a way of making connections with others: building respect and trust. Open has all sorts of dimensions.
"
Finally, Oli asks: "
Who would win in a fight on a beach, a bear or a giant squid? Please show your workings
". It's Saturday morning and I haven't properly caffeinated yet, so I've asked Claude. It thinks that a squid is immediately at a disadvantage on the beach but would win in the water. However, I take issue at the suggestion that a squid's weaponry would be good:
No, thanks. But thanks.

@puntofisso.bsky.social (https://bsky.app/profile/puntofisso.bsky.social)I've done a thing...
Hey, you've probably heard of my interactive web app
Parli-N-Grams (https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/), which charts the frequency of words and phrases in debates at the UK Parliament. Originally, it was for the House of Commons, and over time I added the House of Lords. In January 2025 I've also added new datasets from the amazing mySociety – TheyWorkForYou archives which allow searches through Written Answers and Written Ministerial Statements in both chambers.

A visual timeline of the collision between a passenger plane and a Black Hawk helicopter in DC
Soph Warnes and others at the CNN have done this amazing piece of
visual work (https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/30/us/maps-plane-helicopter-crash-dca-dg/index.html), and released it very quickly.
It's really a great explainer of the tragic accident on the Potomac river.
PRESENTATION: The State of Video Gaming in 2025
I'm not particularly into gaming, but this
slide deck (https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025)by producer Matthew Ball is really interesting and comes with a good eye openers. As you might have heard, the gaming market soared until 2021, when it suddenly stalled and, to most, surprisingly, stalled. The 220 slides (!) explain why, with a few surprises. The chart below, for example – on slide 75.
With thanks to Colin Davis for putting this on my radar.

Geocoding is just the first step
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)Most data projects involve tedious cleaning and enriching before the data can actually be "used".
At OpenCage, we are firm believers that
laziness is one of the virtues of a great developer (https://thethreevirtues.com/). We’ve thought a lot about making geocoding with open data dead simple, but also how to simplify the total journey to using the data.
Our geocoding API returns "
annotations
"
- extra information about the location that developers might find useful, thus saving work.
An example is EU NUTS codes, standard codes commonly used for linking datasets and statistical analysis. Looking up the relevant codes for a region is not particularly complex, but it is the kind small tasks that need to be done correctly (and maintained) in a larger data processing project. So, as a simplification for our users, we already return the correct codes as an annotation.
As an example, a request to the OpenCage geocoder for
52.387, 9.733
(in northern Germany) returns the annotation
"NUTS": {
  "NUTS0": {
    "code": "DE"
  },
  "NUTS1": {
    "code": "DE9"
  },
  "NUTS2": {
    "code": "DE92"
  },
  "NUTS3": {
    "code": "DE929"
  }
},
We also return many other types of information, for example: the local timezone, calling code, currency information, other reference systems like geohash, what3words, MGRS, US FIPS cdes, Maidenhead, the time of sunrise and sunset, the qibla angle, and
much more (https://opencagedata.com/api).

geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

New Frontiers: The Origins and Content of New Work, 1940–2018∗
Ok, this is a chunky (134 pages!)academic paper PDF (https://poid.lse.ac.uk/PUBLICATIONS/abstract.asp). I'll be honest: I haven't read it all. But it comes with quite a few quotable points and charts, including the one below.
"
We find, first, that the majority of current employment is in new job specialties introduced after 1940, but the locus of new work creation has shifted—from middle-paid production and clerical occupations over 1940–1980, to high-paid professional and, secondarily, low-paid services since 1980.

The "exposure to import competition" is, obviously, an interesting concept for our times.
What is the unemployment rate in the US right now?

Excuse this issue's brevity. This one took me some time to write as I'm still recovering from surgery and can't stay sat or stand for long stretches as it gets uncomfortable, but doing very well and I hope to be able to go back to work in a few days. No sports for the next 4 weeks, thought, which means I've been binge-watching the Australian Open on TV and realising how much data now goes into tennis. The linesmen have all disappeared, replaced by electronics. Not sure I like this (given I wanted to get onto a course to become one ahah).

Build or Buy? Should you try to create your own geocoder?
Welcome to part four of our series on geocoding.
Given freely available opensource software, and open data like OpenStreetMap, should you run your own geocoder? Or should you pay a service like ours to host the geocoding software for you?
The whole point of open data is that you can do it yourself, right
?
The short answer is that yes, you can run, or even write, your own geocoder. Unqiue technical requirements may mean it makes sense to craft your own custom service, but most people prefer to leave it experts and get on with their real work.
Our geocoding API
aggregates many different open data sources (https://opencagedata.com/credits)and provides enterprise level reliability. One factor we see many people overlook: setting up the software is one thing, keeping the underlying data current is another. Put another way:
building is easy, maintaining is hard
. OSM alone gets 4-5 million edits per day. Still, as a developer myself and long-time OSM contributor, I understand the inclination to get your hands dirty. Hopefully it helps put you at ease to know that we’re
doing our part to give back to the open data and open source geo software community (https://opencagedata.com/about).
Finally, rest easy knowing that if you ever need to the data and code is all there for you to dive into. That’s
the real power of open-source and open data
.

unlike a standard Mercator projection, you can substitute any point on earth as the "pole". (https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/)(The initial view shows Boston as the pole point.
Furthermore, this map cuts off much, much closer to the poles than normal, allowing you to see many more orders of magnitude of distortion.
Because this yields a map several times taller than it is wide, it is shown sideways from its usual orientation.

Addresses, and why they can be a nightmare.
Good news:
Open, global datasets like OpenStreetMap make getting lots geodata easier than ever.
Bad news:
Now you have to sort through it, which can be an i18n nightmare.
Example:
Given this geodata for a location in Spain - which address would a normal person expect?
"components": {
    "ISO_3166-1_alpha-2": "ES",
    "ISO_3166-1_alpha-3": "ESP",
    "ISO_3166-2": [
        "ES-CT",
        "ES-B"
    ],
    "_category": "building",
    "_normalized_city" : "Barcelona",
    "_type": "building",
    "city": "Barcelona",
    "continent" : "Europe",
    "country" : "Spain",
    "country_code" : "es",
    "county" : "Barcelon\u00e8s",
    "county_code" : "B",
    "house_number" : "66-68",
    "political_union" : "European Union",
    "postcode" : "08017",
    "province" : "Barcelona",
    "quarter" : "les Tres Torres",
    "road" : "Carrer de Calatrava",
    "state" : "Catalonia",
    "state_code" : "CT",
    "suburb" : "Sarri\u00e0 - Sant Gervasi"        
},
At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we’ve
open-sourced the templates (https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting)we use to convert address data into well formatted strings for the 240+ territories around the world, so we know the correct answer is
Carrer de Calatrava, 66-68, 08017 Barcelona, Spain
. This is just one of many small steps we’ve taken to make developer’s lives easier.
Anyone looking for an entertaining view of the technical complexity of addresses should read “
Falsehoods programmers believe about addresses (https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/)”. Meanwhile, in the category of not sure whether to laugh or cry, we have last year's news of
the German town that voted “no” to adopting street names (https://www.dw.com/en/german-town-votes-no-to-street-names/a-47345093).

Why is open geodata important? What's the difference between open and closed data?
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)Proprietary geodata from private services like Google are widely used, but come with licenses that severely restrict how you can use the data. Restrictions include:
don't allow storing (caching) beyond a certain time period, and require deletion when you stop being a customer
limit which maps you can use to display the geodata
require a significantly higher cost to use behind a firewall or in desktop software
no clarity on when or if data will be refreshed or corrected
Open data, like that returned by
the OpenCage geocoding API (https://opencagedata.com/), means:
store data as long as you like
display on any map
use publicly or behind a firewall
fix errors when you find them
As a final bonus, because the data is free (no cost), our service is also
much more affordable (https://opencagedata.com/reducing-your-google-geocoding-costs).
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

Investigating Social Vulnerability to Extreme Heat: Heat Islands and Climate Shelters in Urban Contexts: The Case of Bologna
A team of researchers at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento (Italy): "
n this
article (https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/14/1/17)we present three instruments: (1) a social vulnerability to extreme heat index to identify the areas of a city (and populations thereof) more vulnerable to extreme heat due to climate change (heat islands); (2) a new overall fragility index that incorporates social vulnerability to extreme heat as well as socioeconomic indicators; and (3) a climate shelter index (CSI) to identify areas within a city that can provide relief from extreme heat based on green and blue solutions. We elaborated these three indexes to measure social vulnerability to extreme heat in the municipality of Bologna, which serves as this article’s case study. By analyzing the connections between social vulnerability to extreme heat and several socio-demographic variables in Bologna, we found that a decrease in income is significantly correlated with an increase in social vulnerability to extreme heat in urban contexts. A comparison between our new overall fragility index and the existing index adopted by the municipality of Bologna (Indice di fragilità, Comune di Bologna) showed that about 75% of the statistical areas observed are worse off when social vulnerability to extreme heat is also considered. Considering social vulnerability to extreme heat shows vulnerabilities in a city (here: Bologna) that the pre-existing index did not consider. These findings and our new indexes can support the Bologna administration (and other local administrations) in addressing the consequences of climate change for their most vulnerable residents.

"
3.9 micron data from the GOES-16 East and GOES-18 West satellites on the January 2025 Southern California fires. We download the reprojected data from UW SSEC's RealEarth program. Each image is 128x128 pixels, centered at (34.1, -118.4). Each pixel is 1.0 km. The satellites measure the temperatures of the topmost infrared-opaque region in the atmosphere, which may exaggerate the extent of fires from heated smoke, or hide the extent from cloud cover. You can
see (https://github.com/xingyzt/fire)how quickly the fires initially grow — up to a square mile every minute at first — fueled by dry vegetation and strong winds. This shows the extreme difficulty of containment.

What is geocoding?
Geocoding is translating between geo coordinates (latitude, longitude) and human place descriptions (addresses, placenames, etc). There are two kinds of geocoding:
Forward geocoding
: address to coordinates
Reverse geocoding
: coordinates to address
More smart phones and tracking devices means more geodata is being created than ever before. Geocoding is a first step in processing that data into useful information.
In the coming weeks this series will look at the challenges around geocoding
.
At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we run a highly available, simple to use, worldwide, geocoding API based on open datasets like OpenStreetMap. Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

#590: quantum of sollazzo – 31 Dec 2024
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
·
The most clicked link last week was the fascinating
Subway Stories (https://subwaystories.nyc/)(thanks Blanca!)·
AMA – Ask Me Anything
A shorter newsletter today as I'm still processing my food coma but...
it's AMA o'clock! Welcome to the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Over the past month, you've asked quite a few questions, and I can't answer all of them timely, so here's a selection. I'll try to answer them all over time, so please do keep asking your questions via this anonymous
Google form (https://forms.gle/mVJCeVLrdYmu1eJg9).
An anonymous reader asks: "
Have you joined/considered to join Kaggle competition before? Why/why not?
." I have, but as much as it might surprise some of you, I'm not really a data scientist. I'm more interested in data quality and data coverage, and sharing interesting ways to explore data, like my
Parli-N-Grams (https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/)web app. Sometimes I play with data science, but my data wrangling is relatively elementary, and I find a thrill in
discovery
more than in
competing
. My biggest strength at work is a multidisciplinary understanding of data and the ability to be a bridge between different areas of knowledge. However, I have often used Kaggle to learn what others are doing, what techniques are in and out of fashion, and, most often, simply to find interesting datasets. It's a great resource!
Allan asks: "
What are some interesting new ways that data visualizations are being used to mislead or misdirect? I'm thinking of recent additions to things like different or off Y-axis, etc.
" I'll not point the finger to a specific use, but question points to a very important problem, with the answer being, obviously, "it depends". For example, it makes me think about the debate within the dataviz community about whether it's correct/ethical to cut off the Y-axis. This is the practice of making a chart with a Y-axis that doesn't start at 0, but closer to a value that somewhat highlights the phenomenon that the chart is exploring. This problem had some coverage, for example on the
ONS blog (https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2016/06/27/does-the-axis-have-to-start-at-zero-part-1-line-charts/)(about 8 years ago), with the chart below given as example: "
At this zoom level there looks to be a marked decline and subsequent rise in the data. But is this important or not? Some context might be useful to make sense of this trend.
"
And there it goes: every use of data can be misleading if it doesn't capture the context in which the data was captured and used. In dataviz, which is by nature a summary of a complex reality, this can happen often.
Jez sends an OpenStreetMap question: "
OpenStreetMap, perhaps the most valuable Open database in the world, was created in the UK. How would you raise its profile with UK Government and/or with citizens?
" Oh, this is a beautiful one, and it's a blank canvas to answer :-) First of all, you'd be surprised: as someone who works in Government, I've seen plenty of uses of OSM when presenting geographic data. It's often appreciated by us in the public sector because of its coverage and timeliness of updates. However, it is also true that Ordnance Survey is another treasure of geo-data, especially in Great Britain, and that it comes with some official status – in Government, we can use the full spectrum of Ordnance Survey data thanks to the permissive
PSGA licence (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/customers/public-sector/public-sector-licensing). It's all good competition for the best geodataset. So, in all honesty, I would expect OSM to be more popular with
other
Governments. I have seen some pretty large organisations using it, some of which are listed on the
OSM website (https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/about-osm-community/consumers/)and include the
Italian's Prime Minister's office (https://www.governo.it/it/mappa-del-presidente),  the
Scottish Government's crime report maps (https://datamap-scotland.co.uk/scotland-reported-crime-data/city-of-edinburgh-council-ward-crime-map/), and the
World Bank's project map (https://maps.worldbank.org/)screenshotted below. I'd say that many international organisation are fully aware and use OSM effectively.
Things are different when we talk about the general public, though, because in this cohort success is all about ease of use for navigation – the ability of getting turn-by-turn directions on loudspeaker, for example, is what ultimately drives people to Google or Apple maps. While there are now great apps that offer services like this using OpenStreetMap data (such as
Maps.Me (https://maps.me/)) these are still limited in terms of features and somewhat clunky for the average user. OpenStreetMap doesn't want – and rightly so – to provide a single way of using its data; it's a data source, rather than a map provider, so I suspect that it will never be fully appreciated by the general public as if it did.
Finally, an anonymous reader asks me a personal question about Quantum: "
Are you able to monetize your newsletter enough to justify the time you spend on it? If yes, how long did it take to achieve monetization? If no, why do you still write it?
". Ha, I'm not a newsletter millionaire (for now? :P). While I have occasional sponsors, and accept donations, at the moment I am not looking to massively monetise this newsletter. I've had enough sponsorships and donors over the past 12 years that allow me to cover the server costs, and that's as much as I'm happy to push (things might change one day).
The reason why I write Quantum is not to run a business. For me, it's a tool to distil things I've seen that caught my interest, learn something from it, understand myself and my evolving interests, and building networks and relationships. It gives me joy, and it has allowed me to get in touch with many interesting data folks. There are also indirect benefits, some financial and some non-financial – for example, readers of this newsletter asked me to
freelance (https://puntofisso.medium.com/my-report-on-best-practice-for-local-data-initiatives-313d12f83865)for them, or invited me to speak at their conferences, flying me to Buenos Aires for
csv,conf (https://puntofisso.net/csvconf2023)or Madrid for
TRGCON (https://puntofisso.net/trgcon24/).

Giuseppe shares lessons from his speaking gigs, along with fresh takes on financial success, online habits, and communicating data effectively. Packed with anecdotes, humour, and sharp insights, this episode is a must-listen for anyone navigating the data and tech world.
"
·
Of all the articles I've read and linked to in 2024, one keeps making my brain explode every time I think of it (and, for some reason, I keep thinking of it): "
How to date a recording using background electrical noise (https://robertheaton.com/enf/)" by Robert Heaton. It's very technical and I only understand parts of it. The TL;DR: to prove that a suspect was guilty, the police used a recording, not for the content of the recording but because the "hum" sound in the recording, from electrical interference, matched the frequency of the hum of the electrical network at a certain specific time and place. What's remarkable, aside from the CSI technique, is that such frequency data is openly available throughout most of the developed world.
'till next week and happy new year,
Giuseppe

(via Lucilla Piccari)Which chart types did our users create in 2024?
Rose Mintzer-Sweeney
wraps up (https://blog.datawrapper.de/popular-chart-types-2024/)the year for Datawrapper.
Retirement age vs Life expectancy
One I made. I was looking at the relationship between retirement age and life expectancy, something that was sparked by a conversation at work. Using data from
Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_age)and the
WHO (https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688), I created this
chart (https://www.datawrapper.de/_/oWrIp/). However, there are some caveats that need to be understood: retirement age is for many countries not a fixed date. It changes with age, it will be changing over the next few years, and there are intricate rules almost everywhere. So here I usually captured the earliest date, or the most common date. Dataviz of this kind is hard, but I hope this gives something to think about – especially those countries that seem to have very close retirement age and life expectancy.
Feel free to share, but do share with these caveats if you do.

Alongside Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, a trio sometimes referred to as the “Big Three,” Nadal dominated men’s professional tennis for over two decades. Throughout his career, he won a staggering 82.6% of his singles matches (1080 wins, 228 losses) and amassed 92 ATP singles titles including 22 majors along the way.

For example: content that's not zoomable, interaction that's not available for keyboard users, insights that don't get communicated to screen reader users, lacking text alternatives, semantic errors, or missing explanations.
This time I also ran axe DevTools at the end of the review, which picked up between 3 (NRK) and 62 (Fox News) errors against WCAG 2.1. When including tests against best practices, a total of 870 issues were found on Fox News, 206 on the Washington Post, 24 on Reuters, and 70 on NRK.

Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or

It's AMA o'clock! This is the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Here we are at the second edition of my Ask Me Anything. I think I will keep things this way: I'll let the questions come in for a few weeks, and answer them once a month.
Cole asks me: "What do you think are the greatest opportunities for business researchers in the age of generative AI? Where do you think algorithmic understanding can complement social scientific understanding (and vice-versa)". While we could fill pages trying to answer this question from a philosophical point of view (which I'm not very good at...), I'll give my pragmatic angle (which I'm usually good at...): if we consider generative AI as a tool, it can be transformative as many tools have in the past: the wheel, the hammer, the typewriter, the Internet; all these tool can be and should be mastered in order to be used effectively and safely. I've recently tried using Claude to help on a coding mission; it made me probably ten times faster than if I had started coding from scratch, but it still helped massively that I have coding knowledge, I could spot Claude's errors, re-prompt it (him?) to reformulate, and refactor the code manually. This is how I see AI, any form of AI whether generative or otherwise, and this is where it is proving the real, most ground-breaking impact: not by creating black-boxes that win games – although this is exciting and mind-blowing – but where it augments and speeds up the creativity of human researchers. This is the use that, fundamentally, had led to a Nobel Prize this year. I've seen some of this first-hand when working in the NHS AI Lab: we did a
project with Parkinsons UK (https://transform.england.nhs.uk/ai-lab/explore-all-resources/develop-ai/identifying-and-quantifying-parkinsons-disease-using-ai-on-brain-slices/)which, in just 6 months, created a neural network able to detect Parkinson's Disease in brain slice images, making the work of pathologists 10x faster. This is what I thing of generative AI: a good tool in the right, trained hands.
Duncan asks: "What is the hardest problem in data visualisation?". Beautiful question :) So let me take you through a short story. Here's a slide from my
talk at TRGCON (https://puntofisso.net/trgcon24/):
On this slide, you see two pictures capturing the result of the general election 2018 in Italy through the use of the official electoral data. The one on the left is a beautiful picture made by the very excellent team at the Financial Times. It illustrated an article, which described Italy as a country divided in three, making it very evident that the country is, indeed, divided in three parts. They created this map in the most common way: by showing the colour of the winning party in each constituency.
But look at the map on the right. It's ugly because, erm, I made it, and I'm not the best at graphics. This is a dot map: I show 10,000 votes per party wherever they fall. I used this map to illustrate my story: 2018 Italy is a country that is politically confused.
So, there you have it: two maps that are created using the same data, but tell an entirely different story. You might ask: which one is true? Was Italy in 2018 a divided country or a confused country? Well, to an extent, it was both - and there lies my answer to Duncan. Data visualization always has its own
agenda
. An agenda is not evil by nature: it's just the consequence of the choices we make when we collect and use data (in this case, both the FT team and I had only control on the latter, obviously). These choices give any data visualization a "spin", and for many data visualization practitioners it's hard to come up to terms with this. A data-driven visualization is not neutral. Data is never neutral. Understanding this is the hardest problem in data visualization.
This brings me to a bunch of slightly... provocative questions, which are from Alex, Lucilla, and a few others, who ask me about working in the public sector. I won't say who asks what, but they are all very similar about "what's the worst/most bizarre/most frustrating thing working in the UK public sector". Well, let me tell you first that I very deliberately choose to move into the public sector :) I did so because there's not many other areas where you can use data to have an impact on the lives of million of people, and I find that incredibly exciting. For example, one of my teams looks after the data engine that powers the UK Electoral Roll - that's data about tens of millions of people, checked regularly, that enables the exercise of democracy in our country. Every role, every organisation will have issues of all sorts – after a number of years you either can't face them any longer, and move, or learn to navigate them, work around them, maybe even seeing them as part of a whole. A bit like a long marriage. That applies to pretty much every type of organisation. Working in the public sector is no different.

Mike Tyson Fights Against Age
Flowing Data's Nathan Yau: "
The 58-year-old Mike Tyson fought the 27-year-old Jake Paul, likely wrapping up Tyson’s boxing career that started in 1985 when he was 18. Given the big age difference in the final fight, I wondered the age of past Tyson opponents.

Tips for data entry in Excel
Believe me, you might need
this tutorial (https://cghlewis.com/blog/excel_entry/)at some point :-)"
Research projects often involve some form of data entry. Even if you’re not collecting paper forms that require your team to manually enter the responses (e.g., paper surveys collected in the field need to be manually entered), you’re often still entering some sort of internal record keeping information (e.g., who are our consented participants, what is their contact information, what are their assigned study IDs, what data have we collected on them). There are many reasons that it is typically preferred to enter this information into a database management system (e.g., FileMaker, Microsoft Access, Airtable, LibreOffice Base, Quick Base) as opposed to a spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel. While both spreadsheets and databases hold tabular data, there are several benefits to entering data into a database as opposed to a spreadsheet.

#584: quantum of sollazzo – 19 November 2024
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
It's a shorter issue this time as I was away for TRGCON and my brain was all focussed on rehearsing my talk – back to normal service next week.
·
The most clicked link last week was Count.com's
introduction to metric trees (https://count.co/blog/intro-to-metric-trees).
·
I'm just back from TRGCON '24 and it was one of the best things I've done in my life!
"Todo es posible" is the motto of
TRGCON (https://trgcon.com/)— everything is possible.
When David Bonilla reached out to invite me to give a talk at TRGCON '24, an event I had never heard of, my first reactions were: "is this a really good scam attempt?" and "have they reached out to the wrong Giuseppe?". Man, how wrong I was. The reality: total serendipity. I had been lucky to be found by someone totally outside of my "bubble". As I'm about to fly back to London after an AMAZING event where I literally didn't know anyone, my brain is still buzzing and my heart is very full.
I was a bit terrified of speaking to this 700+ audience at an event that was exclusively in Spanish – mine was one of the only two talks at the event to be in English. The terror turned out to be excitement. I'll post more about my talk later, and a video will be published soon, but, in short I shared a few stories about data that have taught me something, and discussed how these lessons became part of my personal "framework" to be effective using data, whether I'm developing data pipelines, advocating for better data, or using data to back an argument with evidence. I discussed how Agile helps us working in the UK Government run things smoothly, and how the Gov.Uk Service Standard is a brilliant resource to ask ourselves if we're doing things right, to verify we're serving the right user needs, to assure the services we're creating are reliable, maintainable, and sustainable. I shared my view that data is the ultimate multidisciplinary area of knowledge.
Despite my very limited Spanish, I managed to follow and be inspired by the other talks. How not to praise enough
Clara Jiménez Cruz (https://x.com/cjimenezcruz)on her brilliant work and talk on misinformation and fact-checking, something that is close to my heart and with important connotations about public trust, an important topic for us in public service;
Trisha Gee (https://trishagee.com/)spoke about how to set up DevRel as something that can sit anywhere in an corporate organisation, which resonates a lot with the efforts I've always made to turn data into a service to the organisations I work with, a journey with and for colleagues, not something done to them; and Rafael Pons Fedelich speaking on the challenges he's found in launching
a popular mobile app (https://www.photopills.com/)– a reality check for those of us who complain about things being "slow" in Government and "fast" in the startup world (the grass is always greener etc...)I'm really humbled of having been part of this all – an outstanding conference to be inspired from, a new community of makers to learn from, and a good reminder that... I should try and learn Spanish!

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)✨ Topical (yes, there was an election)US Presidential Election Results
"
Bloomberg News is
reporting live election results (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-us-election-results/)in the presidential race between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and her Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump.
"
Some pretty good charts.
Partisan Investing
Not quite my usual source, but I found
this article (https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/partisan-investing)rather interesting and well argued: "
In today’s polarized climate, partisan politics pose a major challenge for investors, especially around elections. We identify “Democratic” and “Republican” stocks based on their political contributions. While such contributions generally represent profitable “investments in influence,” highly partisan donations, particularly from executives, have generated limited shareholder returns. In contrast, “nonpartisan stocks,” which invest in diversified portfolios of candidates from both parties, have delivered excess returns with lower political risk.
"
It also offers a historical perspective.
How early risers, gossip-spreaders, UFO-seers and more lean in the presidential election
YouGov: "
YouGov's extensive
compilation (https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50868-how-early-risers-gossip-spreaders-ufo-seers-and-more-lean-in-the-presidential-election)of polls from recent months captures the expected and unexpected ways that Americans are split over the 2024 election. Harris does better with atheists, renters, and people with college degrees — and also with people who like to see movies in theaters or to sleep in. Trump does better with people who are Protestant, married, or live in rural areas — and also with people who have been in a car crash or think they've seen a UFO.

And I'm a total sucker for a good log odds chart.

It's AMA o'clock! Ask Me Anything.
Here's the first set of answers to the questions you've asked – I've started receiving an interesting collection of questions about data, about my job, and quite a few fun jokes (I know who you are...). I'll answer more in the next few issues :)Rares Ciurezu asks me this very interesting, deeply technical question: "
What is the best way to present INRIX Travel Time Journey Data for motorized vehicles? I have a large dataset that contains thousands of links and data at 15-minute intervals from GPS data. Is there a best practice guide I can use?
"
Now, I'm not an expert in the direct use of INRIX data, but I have a couple of hints. First of all, for the uninitiated, INRIX is a provider of transport data. Their data is
available (https://docs.inrix.com/datadownload/datadownload/)and, while not open data, it's widely used within both the public and private sector and my colleagues at the Department for Transport mentioned it many times. This question makes me think of two potential places to start looking at.
First of all, the
Charting Transport (https://chartingtransport.com/)blog by transport geek Chris Loader offers many visualizations of traffic data, centred in Australia, and could provide a few ideas.
Secondly, the way Rares describes the data as a combination of regular intervals and location makes me think that it might be a good fit for a Marey diagram.
If you have never heard of Marey diagrams, they are an amazing tool to explore how regular or irregular public transit is. They were invented by French scientist
Étienne-Jules Marey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey)and have been applied to, for example,
buses in Sydney (https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/11/visualising-sydney-bus-congestion-with-marey-charts/)and the
metro in New York City (https://mbtaviz.github.io/)– the latter is where the screenshot below comes from. Maybe an option for the INRIX data is to consider, instead of individual cars, groups of cars – for example, all cars that start their trip between 10:30-10:40, or other groups calculated with some form of clustering.
Morten Lind asks: "
What is correct: Data are or data is?
" – probably knowing he won't get a straight answer from me :D In fact, I asked this exact questions to about 50 data gurus I interviewed in Quantum of Sollazzo (you can find these in the
archive (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/), starting from
issue 420 (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/archive/420-quantum-of-sollazzo/)).
You will find that many will say that the correct form would be "data are"... except the way we refer to data today as a collective noun makes "data is" more appealing. And that's more or less what I end up doing – I say "data is" because it sounds better.
As Jeremy Singer-Vine (
issue 421 (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/archive/421-quantum-of-sollazzo/)) made me realise, there is an interesting
historical analysis (https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph)of this, thanks to Google Books Ngram Viewer.
Or you can do what Sam Joiner suggested in
issue 445 (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/archive/445-quantum-of-sollazzo/)and avoid the problem at all by saying "the data analysis", "the dataset", etc...
Finally, Guy asks me "
Why are your jokes so bad?
". They are, indeed they are. Bad puns and dad jokes have become part of my "brand", haven't they? Well, my theory is: if people don't run away after being repeated inflicted my terrible jokes, we can discuss more difficult topics...

Evaluating modern ML models is hard. The strong incentive for researchers and companies to report a state-of-the-art result on some metric often leads to questionable research practices (QRPs): bad practices which fall short of outright research fraud. We describe 43 such practices which can undermine reported results, giving examples where possible. Our list emphasises the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on public benchmarks. We also discuss "irreproducible research practices", i.e. decisions that make it difficult or impossible for other researchers to reproduce, build on or audit previous research.

How to date a recording using background electrical noise
Rather geeky and tangentially data, but really worth a read, by Robert Heaton. The key
concept (https://robertheaton.com/enf/)to understand is that the mains electricity, which provides AC – Alternate Current – alternates between different voltages at a given frequency. While this is usually reported as 50 Hz, it is in fact oscillating between different frequencies in an established pattern which varies from time to time. This can give a hint as to when a recording was made, if it did capture the "hum" of electric interference. Source code is also provided
here (https://github.com/robert/enf-matching).
Oh, and by the way, Fourier Transforms are an amazing tool.

The Olympics 100m really captured everyone's attention – I received multiple tips about the excellent use of data visualization for the Olympics 100m race. Starting with the dataviz-heavy

35% Faster Than The Filesystem
This is what SQLite now
claims (https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html)to be. I've got to say I increasingly use it in my personal projects, when they don't need frequent, concurrent writes.
"
SQLite reads and writes small blobs (for example, thumbnail images) 35% faster¹ than the same blobs can be read from or written to individual files on disk using fread() or fwrite().
Furthermore, a single SQLite database holding 10-kilobyte blobs uses about 20% less disk space than storing the blobs in individual files.
The performance difference arises (we believe) because when working from an SQLite database, the open() and close() system calls are invoked only once, whereas open() and close() are invoked once for each blob when using blobs stored in individual files. It appears that the overhead of calling open() and close() is greater than the overhead of using the database. The size reduction arises from the fact that individual files are padded out to the next multiple of the filesystem block size, whereas the blobs are packed more tightly into an SQLite database.
The measurements in this article were made during the week of 2017-06-05 using a version of SQLite in between 3.19.2 and 3.20.0. You may expect future versions of SQLite to perform even better.

Dinosaurs: Long dead but still on the move
Datawrapper's Jonathan Muth: "
My first idea was to create a map showing where the bones of famous dinosaurs were found. I picked everyone’s favorites — Tyrannosaurus, Ceratops, Stegosaurus, Brachiosaurus and Ankylosaurus. But while I was putting the dig sites on a map, another thought crossed my mind:
This isn’t where these dinos actually died (https://blog.datawrapper.de/dinosaur-bones-continental-drift/).

This is a pretty cool idea.

The Open Data Institute: "
This
white paper (https://theodi.org/insights/reports/building-a-better-future-with-data-and-ai-a-white-paper/)outlines our vision for artificial intelligence (AI) in the UK, emphasising the need for robust data infrastructure, governance and ethical foundations to support the tech ecosystem.

Questionable practices in machine learning
Pre-print klaxon here – "
Evaluating modern ML models is hard. The strong incentive for researchers and companies to report a state-of-the-art result on some metric often leads to questionable research practices (QRPs): bad practices which fall short of outright research fraud. We describe 43 such practices which can undermine reported results, giving examples where possible.
Our list (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12220)emphasises the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on public benchmarks. We also discuss "irreproducible research practices", i.e. decisions that make it difficult or impossible for other researchers to reproduce, build on or audit previous research.

Every map of China is wrong
Well, not quite, but catchy title :-) I didn't know about the "
China GPS shift (https://medium.com/@anastasia.bizyayeva/every-map-of-china-is-wrong-bc2bce145db2)" and it was very interesting to learn about. This seems to be a national security decision, which boils down to the fact that "
companies outside of China need to have a Chinese mapping partner in order to provide data about Chinese locations.
"
Most notably, it seems to cause a misalignment between Google Maps and Google StreetView, and it's a reminder that geospatial data is not easy to understand and interpret without knowledge of geography, history, and politics.

What to do with age? Linear, Discrete, Both, or Spline
Academic Vincent Arel-Bundock writes: "
In a blog post, Andrew Gelman (2024) relays this question:
“The subgroups they examine are 65-74 years old, 75-84, and >85. I’ve seen these types of binning common in medical studies. But why? The actual ages are certainly known, so why not treat age as a continuous variable?”
Gelman’s answer is:
“Discrete binning isn’t perfect, but it’s transparent and can be better than a simple linear model.”
The
idea (https://arelbundock.com/posts/age_linear_discrete/age_linear_discrete.html)is that fitting a model with multiple coefficients associated with bin-specific binary variables allows more flexibility than a model where age is entered purely linearly, with a single coefficient. The downsides of this strategy are that binning “wastes” information by coarsening a fine-grained measure and that the cutpoints of the age bins can sometimes feel arbitrary.
As Gelman notes, however, analysts can get the best of both worlds by including age as both a set of bins and as a single continuous variable.

looks up (https://blog.datawrapper.de/meteorite-recorded-history/)at the sky. "
This map shows every meteorite that has been seen by humans or measuring devices and where it fell down to earth. The symbols are sized by the weight of the meteorite and colored by the year it was observed. The two oldest recorded meteorites fell in Nogata, Japan in the year 860 and in Narni, Italy in 921. While there are several other very old collisions on this map, most of them were witnessed after 1800.

Dynamics of Corporate Governance Beyond Ownership in AI
Think-tank Common Wealth: "
Big Tech dominates investment in AI technology;
a public strategy for regulation (https://www.common-wealth.org/publications/dynamics-of-corporate-governance-beyond-ownership-in-ai)is crucial to challenge uneven distributions of economic power.
"
This is interesting as it's taking a critical stance on open source, which I'm sure will generate quite a bit of debate.
(via Durand D'souza)ChatGPT is bullshit
"
Recently, there has been considerable interest in large language models: machine learning systems which produce human-like text and dialogue. Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.

The most instinctive reaction to wanting data is to collect and store as much of it as you can, figure it out later. For many reasons, that's probably a
bad idea (https://www.counting-stuff.com/youre-collecting-too-much-data/).
"
I've seen a few of articles recently that fundamentally address the same question: of all the promises of big data, very few use cases have actually seen success. This is either because there wasn't, in fact, data that was so big to begin with, or that regardless of how big the data is (are? :P), any analysis is only useful for a tiny subset.

Most of them simulate data according to the rules of a model, plot the simulated data, and report statistical results obtained by fitting the simulated data to the model from which they were generated.   The user can adjust values of model parameters or change features of the model, then see what happens to the plotted data and to the statistical results.   Most apps have an option to change the random seed, which will generate a new (pseudo-) random set of data.

Models All The Way Down

If you want to make a really big AI model — the kind that can generate images or do your homework, or build this website, or fake a moon landing — you start by finding a really big training set.

BIG DATA IS DEAD
"
For more than a decade now, the fact that people have a hard time gaining actionable insights from their data has been blamed on its size. “Your data is too big for your puny systems,” was the diagnosis, and the cure was to buy some new fancy technology that can handle massive scale. Of course, after the Big Data task force purchased all new tooling and migrated from Legacy systems, people found that they still were having trouble making sense of their data. They also may have noticed, if they were really paying attention, that
data size wasn’t really the problem at all (https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/).

Nerd, tech, and with a hint of Bologna, you say? Well, that's basically me, so let me link you to this
project (https://diumari.com/pages/campionato)by Spencer Wright (founder of Scope of Work / formerly The Prepared, which I've occasionally linked to), "
Il Campionato Mondiale di  Umari
".
Here's what it is: "
Umari is the plural form of umarell, and umarell is a jocular Italian term for a person – classically a man of retirement age – who pauses to observe work in progress. The term might be used as light-hearted mockery in Italy, but we think more people ought to umarell; this website is dedicated to that effort.
To umarell is to take an interest in the built environment – this world we move through that our species created, in which most of us spend most of our time. Our lives turn the city into a grey blur, a backdrop to our transits, an obstacle course to negotiate. This is a shame.
Buildings are the redwoods of our time: We’re surrounded by them, they tower over us, and nearly every building you see will be standing long after you’re gone. They ought to be a source of awe and wonder, as much as mountains are, or birds. They’re just as easy to ignore, because they’re so commonplace, and initially offer nothing to hold our attention. But attention is fractal – if you wake up to the city, the city will awaken around you.
We hope you’ll give it a try.

Waffle charts (https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/sketchy-waffle-charts-r)can be used to visualise counts or percentages of categorical data. This blog post describes a slightly unusual solution to creating sketchy looking waffle charts in R using the {sf} and {roughsf} packages.

As much as R is not my language of choice, I find its versatility in creating amazing looking charts pretty outstanding, with (usually) fewer headaches around imports, which often make my beloved Python a little infuriating.

Minority genders in quantitative survey research: a data-driven approach to clear, inclusive, and accurate gender questions
Academic paper (https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingvan-2023-0025/html)KLAXON: "
Whilst linguistic research on speakers of minority genders has increased in the past decade, much less is known about how they can best be included in broader (socio)linguistic research. The current paper compares the way a range of five different gender measures for survey research are filled out and evaluated by a sample of LGBTQ+ people (N = 682). It finds that providing a larger range of answering options allows researchers to gain a better view of the gender diversity in their sample, whilst preventing refusals and loss of participants. The gender question that was least likely to be refused and was rated the most accurate, most inclusive, and clearest was a six-option multiple-choice question which included a “prefer not to say” and a write-in option. This question reconciles two competing interests in the treatment of queer data: it explicitly recognizes and names minority genders and simultaneously carves out space for participants to refuse categorization or write out gender identities beyond those preset by the researcher.

The data consists of categorized project launch dates, not end dates, so we’re not exploring project longevity here.We’ve broadly divided the collection up between the tech (products, apps, websites) and the social (everything that people do: the conferences, funders, meetups of civic tech). We also track adjacent and foundational projects that aren’t explicitly civic tech, but are necessary for civic tech to have meaning: issues like broadly available internet connectivity and racial, gender, and linguistic diversity online.

Sponsorship news
As of last week, I've announced to my Github sponsors that I'm ceasing to accept sponsorship for this newsletter. This is the consequence of a few reflections, including the fact that I never intended to run this newsletter as a "for profit" initiative, and patronage was originally a way to pay the expenses and create a community around the newsletter.
But with my day job keeping me too busy to invest more time in the community and the occasional commercial sponsor, as well as the many opportunities that this newsletter has opened up for me, I decided it was time to let go of formal patronage (occasional relevant ads might still appear).
A huge thank you to everyone who sponsored Quantum – some have gone on for years.

What Great Data Analysts Do — and Why Every Organization Needs Them
A big cheer for data analysts (https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them).
"
“Full-stack” data scientist means mastery of machine learning, statistics, and analytics. Today’s fashion in data science favors flashy sophistication with a dash of sci-fi, making AI and machine learning the darlings of the job market. Alternative challengers for the alpha spot come from statistics, thanks to a century-long reputation for rigor and mathematical superiority. What about analysts?Whereas excellence in statistics is about rigor and excellence in machine learning is about performance, excellence in analytics is all about speed. Analysts are your best bet for coming up with those hypotheses in the first place. As analysts mature, they’ll begin to get the hang of judging what’s important in addition to what’s interesting, allowing decision-makers to step away from the middleman role. Of the three breeds, analysts are the most likely heirs to the decision throne.
"
Interestingly, I think that "data analyst" as a job title has gone out of fashion for many (wrong) reasons, or it has become associated with clerical or financial roles that are often unappealing to the data crowd. And yet, it's a label that I often find pretty descriptive about what many data workers actually do in their job.

Challenge: Predicting [Lunar] Eclipses
"
Those questions always lurked in the back of my mind until over the holiday season when I was idly surfing YouTube (specifically, I bumped on this and this). There I learned about the Saros cycles — “a period of 6585.3211 days (14 common years + 4 leap years + 11.321 days, or 13 common years + 5 leap years + 10.321 days), is useful for predicting the times at which nearly identical eclipses will occur.“ (from Wikipedia).
"
Pretty fun, geeky
article (https://www.counting-stuff.com/predicting-eclipse-challenge-phase-65949948516031001b3512d6/)that will teach you a thing or two.
From the same author, there is also some
travel planning advice (https://www.counting-stuff.com/last-minute-eclipse-math-o), using some of the aforementioned techniques.
Where does America’s coffee come from?
"
Aside from a small fraction grown in Hawaii, all of America’s coffee comes

VACS provides a unified investment framework for stakeholders to advance these goals.

Unlike with generative AI, anybody with a pen, paper and three minutes to spare can write a list of what they do better with a smartphone in hand, and what they do better when the smartphone is out of sight. The challenge is to remember that list and act accordingly.

Fine particles in the air: Ljubljana among the most polluted European cities
From the European Data Journalism network: "
Fine particle pollution (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/fine-particles-in-the-air-ljubljana-among-the-most-polluted-european-cities/)causes premature births, illness, and, in Slovenia, more than 800 preventable deaths every year.
"
I remember looking into this quite a bit when I moved from Bologna to London. I'm not sure if this is still the case, but in the mid-2000s Bologna used to have a level of fine particles that was way over that of London, probably caused by the almost total lack of wind and the topography of the hills surrounding the town. The feeling of choking was common.

Milk production in the US has almost

New tools, processes, stakeholders in every part of the business, entrenched beliefs and opinions, and unspoken expectations. The things that make it difficult to begin as a Head of Data are the same things that make it difficult to thrive as a Head of Data.

Nathan Yau (Flowing Data): "
About 22 percent of physicians in the United States are Asian, but Asian people only make up about 6 percent of the total working population. Compare the former to the latter, and you could say that Asian people are about 3.5 times more likely to be physicians.

Translating OpenStreetMap data to HTML5 Canvas with Rust and WebAssembly
"
I'm working on a revamp of an old
project (https://mary.codes/blog/programming/translating_openstreetmaps_to_HTML5_canvas_rust_wasm/)of mine called Line Buddy (github). It used a now-deprecated API library called themeparks (github) and A-Frame to visually represent the wait times in the Disney World theme parks in 3D.
The original project used OpenStreetMap screenshots as the base, with columns representing the wait times. (They're all zero now since this version of the API no longer works.)My plan is to use OpenStreetMap data to create a simplified version of the map. Eventually, I'll create the map in 3D. As a proof of concept, however, I'm going to draw to an HTML5 canvas first. I want to make sure that I'm able to get the data that I need, process it, and use it to create my own maps.

Geocoding at scale
In our final installment in our series about using open data for geocoding we contemplate the challenges of geocoding at scale. What are the issues you face when you have many hundreds of thousands or even millions of coordinates or addresses to work on daily? At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we serve numerous customers in this category, and a common question that comes up is whether an API based solution can handle that type of scale.
An API-based solution, managed by experts, is almost always the most reliable and most affordable way to develop such an on-going system, as otherwise you will soon be spending a lot of valuable developer time making sure your geodata is staying current. As anyone who has worked with software can confirm: “
Building is easy, maintaining is hard
”.
Nevertheless, there are challenges that come with depending on any external service, one of course being network availability. At OpenCage we have multiple, fully-redundant data centers, and the availability of our service is independently and publicly monitored by a third party (current and past operational status can be seen at
status.opencagedata.com (https://status.opencagedata.com/)).
Still, even with a highly-available service, some customers worry about the “cost” of crossing the internet to an external service. The fastest API query is the one you don’t even make; a smart caching strategy can go a long way to reducing usage. Because our geocoding API is built on open data you can cache the results as long as you like, and we’ve
published a few tips and points to consider (https://opencagedata.com/api).
We hope you’ve enjoyed our series on the issues around geocoding with open data. While we’ve used our service as the example, we believe many of the concepts and considerations will apply regardless of the data processing tools and services you are building on. If you have questions regarding anything we discussed,
please get in touch (https://opencagedata.com/contact).
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

🤯 Data thinking
The House of Lords could liberate the Postcode Address File if they back this amendment
This makes me nostalgic about that time of Open Data... Ah well, the story of PAF is famous in that it represented an intensely intellectual and political debate between those who thought that the state-run database should be released with an open licence, as it had already been "paid for" by the taxpayer, and those who believed that the state had a duty to maximise its revenue from it on behalf of the taxpayer. In the end, PAF was privatised alongside its hosting organisation (although it's not that simple – local government still plays a large role).
I thought that the argument on PAF had been settled, but it looks like there's
something brewing in the House of Lords (https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/the-house-of-lords-could-liberate). Regardless of what happens, it's an interesting debate to witness, as it raises a lot of very interesting discussions about deeply technical aspects of data operations and sharing.
Is the "Modern Data Stack" Still a Useful Idea?
"
We continue to be in the deployment phase for the MDS. The modern data stack that we’ve all come to love over the past decade isn’t going anywhere; its categories are getting increasingly mature and increasingly well-integrated. Its technologies and best practices are getting more widely deployed, both to more companies and more broadly inside of companies.
This is the phase of any cycle where the real work gets done and where the real value gets created. It’s the phase for getting living in the trenches and solving real problems. The MDS was the future five years ago and it’s still the future today, but we actually have to roll up our sleeves to make the replatforming happen.
Over the last month this has been bugging me. I don’t know if you’ve ever had that nagging feeling after writing something that just doesn’t feel right, but writing this knocked something loose in my head. Since then, I’ve become a little obsessed with the question:
what’s going on with the modern data stack? (https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/is-the-modern-data-stack-still-a)"

Geocoding is just the first step
Most data projects involve tedious cleaning and enriching before the data can actually be "used".
At OpenCage, we are firm believers that
laziness is one of the virtues of a great developer (https://thethreevirtues.com/). We’ve thought a lot about making geocoding with open data dead simple, but also how to simplify the total journey to using the data.
Our geocoding API returns "
annotations
"
- extra information about the location that developers might find useful, thus saving work.
An example is EU NUTS codes, standard codes commonly used for linking datasets and statistical analysis. Looking up the relevant codes for a region is not particularly complex, but it is the kind small tasks that need to be done correctly (and maintained) in a larger data processing project. So, as a simplification for our users, we already return the correct codes as an annotation.
As an example, a request to the OpenCage geocoder for
52.387, 9.733
(in northern Germany) returns the annotation
"NUTS": {
  "NUTS0": {
    "code": "DE"
  },
  "NUTS1": {
    "code": "DE9"
  },
  "NUTS2": {
    "code": "DE92"
  },
  "NUTS3": {
    "code": "DE929"
  }
},
We also return many other types of information, for example: the local timezone, calling code, currency information, other reference systems like geohash, what3words, MGRS, US FIPS cdes, Maidenhead, the time of sunrise and sunset, the qibla angle, and
much more (https://opencagedata.com/api).

Build or Buy? Should you try to create your own geocoder?
Welcome to part four of our series on geocoding.
Given freely available opensource software, and open data like OpenStreetMap, should you run your own geocoder? Or should you pay a service like ours to host the geocoding software for you?
The whole point of open data is that you can do it yourself, right
?
The short answer is that yes, you can run, or even write, your own geocoder. Unqiue technical requirements may mean it makes sense to craft your own custom service, but most people prefer to leave it experts and get on with their real work.
Our geocoding API
aggregates many different open data sources (https://opencagedata.com/credits)and provides enterprise level reliability. One factor we see many people overlook: setting up the software is one thing, keeping the underlying data current is another. Put another way:
building is easy, maintaining is hard
. OSM alone gets 4-5 million edits per day. Still, as a developer myself and long-time OSM contributor, I understand the inclination to get your hands dirty. Hopefully it helps put you at ease to know that we’re
doing our part to give back to the open data and open source geo software community (https://opencagedata.com/about).
Finally, rest easy knowing that if you ever need to the data and code is all there for you to dive into. That’s
the real power of open-source and open data
.
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

Trump’s biggest Iowa gains are in evangelical areas, smallest wins in cities
Analysis (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/16/trump-iowa-evangelical-vote/)by the Washington Post: "
Trump dominated the caucuses in the style of other Republican winners of the past 20 years, a pattern that works in Iowa but did not propel them to win the nomination. Meanwhile, Trump’s weakest performance was in the parts of Iowa that more closely resemble the rest of the country, with fewer White evangelical Christians, fewer farmers and more people living in cities with higher education and more income.

Good news:
Open, global datasets like OpenStreetMap make getting lots geodata easier than ever.
Bad news:
Now you have to sort through it, which can be an i18n nightmare.
Example:
Given this geodata for a location in Spain - which address would a normal person expect?

        "ISO_3166-1_alpha-3": "ESP",
        "ISO_3166-2": [
          "ES-CT",
          "ES-B"
        ],
        "_category": "building",
        "_type": "building",
        "city": "Barcelona",
        "city_district": "Sarrià - Sant Gervasi",

At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we’ve
open-sourced the templates (https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting)we use to convert address data into well formatted strings for the 240+ territories around the world, so we know the correct answer is
Carrer de Calatrava, 68, 08017 Barcelona, España
. This is just one of many small steps we’ve taken to make developer’s lives easier.

Geocoding at scale
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)In our final installment in our series about using open data for geocoding we contemplate the challenges of geocoding at scale. What are the issues you face when you have many hundreds of thousands or even millions of coordinates or addresses to work on daily? At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we serve numerous customers in this category, and a common question that comes up is whether an API based solution can handle that type of scale.
An API-based solution, managed by experts, is almost always the most reliable and most affordable way to develop such an on-going system, as otherwise you will soon be spending a lot of valuable developer time making sure your geodata is staying current. As anyone who has worked with software can confirm: “
Building is easy, maintaining is hard
”.
Nevertheless, there are challenges that come with depending on any external service, one of course being network availability. At OpenCage we have multiple, fully-redundant data centers, and the availability of our service is independently and publicly monitored by a third party (current and past operational status can be seen at
status.opencagedata.com (https://status.opencagedata.com/)).
Still, even with a highly-available service, some customers worry about the “cost” of crossing the internet to an external service. The fastest API query is the one you don’t even make; a smart caching strategy can go a long way to reducing usage. Because our geocoding API is built on open data you can cache the results as long as you like, and we’ve
published a few tips and points to consider (https://opencagedata.com/api).
We hope you’ve enjoyed our series on the issues around geocoding with open data. While we’ve used our service as the example, we believe many of the concepts and considerations will apply regardless of the data processing tools and services you are building on. If you have questions regarding anything we discussed,
please get in touch (https://opencagedata.com/contact).
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

We have easy access to data from folks from the broader population during the same time period, so the goal isn’t so bad as far as quasi-experiments go.1 The team would like to improve the comparisons by using matching, and we have some missing data issues in the matching covariate set. I haven’t done an analysis quite like this before, so this post is a walk-through of the basic statistical procedure as I see it.

It's AMA o'clock! This is the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Here's a few questions and answers you asked me over the past month.
Jessica Nichols asks "
What was your most memorable data related
thing
from 2024?
".
One must surely be the advances we've witnesses in LLMs and the impact they're having on services, the future of work, and the value, or perceived value, of companies. The latter point is particularly hot, just look at the chart of the NVIDIA stock value below. Throughout 2024, NVIDIA more than doubled its value thanks to its perceived value increasing due to progress in tools like ChatGPT and other Western world based AI companies that create LLMs that are trained using NVIDIA chips; however, in early 2025, it very quickly lost over 20% because of news from China, where DeepSeek seems to have released models that can be trained much more cheaply, and using hardware than is cheaper to source than that produced by NVIDIA. The impact of these fluctuations on society, investments, pension funds, etc, is huge. The thing about it is that the value produced by these impact is not easy to determine, and often doesn't translate to profitability.
But I also have to say that I've been trying some of these tools and they are indeed a massive productivity injection. The one I've worked the most is Anthropic's Claude, which I've used as a pair programming buddy. While it often doesn't get everything right, you can conversationally reason about code, add tests, debug, seek alternatives. While I still don't think you can use the code it produces straight out of the box, I must recognise that it's making my coding more solid more quickly. It does feel like pair programming with someone who's oddly both less experienced on broader issues, but also pretty good at hands on wrangling.
Asun says "
I'm in my late forties, doing an MA in data science -- my background is computational linguistics -- because I thought it would be interesting work and I would learn useful tools (and so far, I was right). I would like to work on a freelance basis rather than as a company employee -- possibly together with other sources of income, at least to begin with.
I plan on working on my own projects and will continue to learn (always), but I would be very grateful for any advice you could give me
."
Well, I'm not sure I can give more advice than what Asun is already doing pretty well: learn something you enjoy, see the connections with other areas of practice, offer them whenever you see a "you-shaped" hole. If you can afford financially to sacrifice a few days a month to self-development by creating your own projects, that will work out pretty well over time. When, in 2011, I created
LiveRugby (https://liverugbyapp.puntofisso.net/), I thought it would be a hit and I'd make a regular income out of it. Not just I made no money at all – if anything, I lost some! But it set me on a course to use what I learned to create other sources of data-driven income (and, in a way, I wouldn't be in my current job if I hadn't tried launching that app). My only advice is: aim for the star, but accept that failure is part of the journey. Ask yourself: what could be the value of doing this, if it fails? If you have an answer, keep doing it.
Stefano Gatti (author of this
splendid newsletter (https://stefanogatti.substack.com/)) asks "
What's your opinion on Open Data movement in Uk, in Europe and in USA? I'd like in particular to know your point of view about the impact on society and business.
"
We could write a book together about this, Stefano. The Open Data movement became mainstream at a time of political and societal change sweeping through the world, after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the global financial crisis had shown two major points: first, the value of transparency in helping challenge and scrutinise power; second, the power of data and technology in understanding a problem and taking action towards it. Has it had impact? Some, for sure. For example, in the UK, we have some
excellent monitoring of river levels thanks to open data (https://www.gaugemap.co.uk/). But I think that open data was, in many ways, a disappointing revolution. This is in part because we, as activists, didn't manage to truly win the argument of embedding data and open data into processes (well, I'm working on this in Government now, but in my case this is hardly open data as it's centred on individual-level data). But an important part of that disappointment stems from the fact societal problems are becoming more difficult, more global, changing more frequently – data is equally growing, becoming more complex, harder to process without infrastructure. Yes, we can access satellite imagery to monitor fires in California; but not everyone has the ability and capability to process data like this at home, it's not like an Excel spreadsheet to check where grant funding is going (important, but with a much lower barrier). This means that the ideal of dumping a dataset on a portal and expecting civic society to help is harder to achieve.
However, the positive impact of Open Data as a movement is how it allowed people to consider that more collaboration, communication, engagement, and evidence-driven processes, can create better outcomes. I always quote the
words of former Permanent Secretary Clare Moriarty (https://www.fda.org.uk/news/clare-moriarty-women-into-leadership-speech/): "
It started with a commitment to open data which led to us releasing 10,000 data sets in a year, including some truly massive ones. But opening our data was at most half the issue. More important was the effect it had on open working among colleagues across many organisations in the Defra group, and with a range of external partners from universities to charities to commercial organisations.
That led to interesting discussions about how open government relates to accountability, and also to user-centred design. It took us into how we can be more open as individuals, sharing a bit more about ourselves as a way of making connections with others: building respect and trust. Open has all sorts of dimensions.
"
Finally, Oli asks: "
Who would win in a fight on a beach, a bear or a giant squid? Please show your workings
". It's Saturday morning and I haven't properly caffeinated yet, so I've asked Claude. It thinks that a squid is immediately at a disadvantage on the beach but would win in the water. However, I take issue at the suggestion that a squid's weaponry would be good:
No, thanks. But thanks.

Hey, you've probably heard of my interactive web app
Parli-N-Grams (https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/), which charts the frequency of words and phrases in debates at the UK Parliament. Originally, it was for the House of Commons, and over time I added the House of Lords. In January 2025 I've also added new datasets from the amazing mySociety – TheyWorkForYou archives which allow searches through Written Answers and Written Ministerial Statements in both chambers.

I'm not particularly into gaming, but this

As you might have heard, the gaming market soared until 2021, when it suddenly stalled and, to most, surprisingly, stalled. The 220 slides (!) explain why, with a few surprises. The chart below, for example – on slide 75.

Geocoding is just the first step
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)Most data projects involve tedious cleaning and enriching before the data can actually be "used".
At OpenCage, we are firm believers that
laziness is one of the virtues of a great developer (https://thethreevirtues.com/). We’ve thought a lot about making geocoding with open data dead simple, but also how to simplify the total journey to using the data.
Our geocoding API returns "
annotations
"
- extra information about the location that developers might find useful, thus saving work.
An example is EU NUTS codes, standard codes commonly used for linking datasets and statistical analysis. Looking up the relevant codes for a region is not particularly complex, but it is the kind small tasks that need to be done correctly (and maintained) in a larger data processing project. So, as a simplification for our users, we already return the correct codes as an annotation.
As an example, a request to the OpenCage geocoder for
52.387, 9.733
(in northern Germany) returns the annotation
"NUTS": {
  "NUTS0": {
    "code": "DE"
  },
  "NUTS1": {
    "code": "DE9"
  },
  "NUTS2": {
    "code": "DE92"
  },
  "NUTS3": {
    "code": "DE929"
  }
},
We also return many other types of information, for example: the local timezone, calling code, currency information, other reference systems like geohash, what3words, MGRS, US FIPS cdes, Maidenhead, the time of sunrise and sunset, the qibla angle, and
much more (https://opencagedata.com/api).

geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

"
We find, first, that the majority of current employment is in new job specialties introduced after 1940, but the locus of new work creation has shifted—from middle-paid production and clerical occupations over 1940–1980, to high-paid professional and, secondarily, low-paid services since 1980.

Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
Excuse this issue's brevity. This one took me some time to write as I'm still recovering from surgery and can't stay sat or stand for long stretches as it gets uncomfortable, but doing very well and I hope to be able to go back to work in a few days. No sports for the next 4 weeks, thought, which means I've been binge-watching the Australian Open on TV and realising how much data now goes into tennis. The linesmen have all disappeared, replaced by electronics. Not sure I like this (given I wanted to get onto a course to become one ahah).

Build or Buy? Should you try to create your own geocoder?
Welcome to part four of our series on geocoding.
Given freely available opensource software, and open data like OpenStreetMap, should you run your own geocoder? Or should you pay a service like ours to host the geocoding software for you?
The whole point of open data is that you can do it yourself, right
?
The short answer is that yes, you can run, or even write, your own geocoder. Unqiue technical requirements may mean it makes sense to craft your own custom service, but most people prefer to leave it experts and get on with their real work.
Our geocoding API
aggregates many different open data sources (https://opencagedata.com/credits)and provides enterprise level reliability. One factor we see many people overlook: setting up the software is one thing, keeping the underlying data current is another. Put another way:
building is easy, maintaining is hard
. OSM alone gets 4-5 million edits per day. Still, as a developer myself and long-time OSM contributor, I understand the inclination to get your hands dirty. Hopefully it helps put you at ease to know that we’re
doing our part to give back to the open data and open source geo software community (https://opencagedata.com/about).
Finally, rest easy knowing that if you ever need to the data and code is all there for you to dive into. That’s
the real power of open-source and open data
.

The map you see is the Mercator projection.
But
unlike a standard Mercator projection, you can substitute any point on earth as the "pole". (https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/)(The initial view shows Boston as the pole point.
Furthermore, this map cuts off much, much closer to the poles than normal, allowing you to see many more orders of magnitude of distortion.
Because this yields a map several times taller than it is wide, it is shown sideways from its usual orientation.

Addresses, and why they can be a nightmare.
Good news:
Open, global datasets like OpenStreetMap make getting lots geodata easier than ever.
Bad news:
Now you have to sort through it, which can be an i18n nightmare.
Example:
Given this geodata for a location in Spain - which address would a normal person expect?
"components": {
    "ISO_3166-1_alpha-2": "ES",
    "ISO_3166-1_alpha-3": "ESP",
    "ISO_3166-2": [
        "ES-CT",
        "ES-B"
    ],
    "_category": "building",
    "_normalized_city" : "Barcelona",
    "_type": "building",
    "city": "Barcelona",
    "continent" : "Europe",
    "country" : "Spain",
    "country_code" : "es",
    "county" : "Barcelon\u00e8s",
    "county_code" : "B",
    "house_number" : "66-68",
    "political_union" : "European Union",
    "postcode" : "08017",
    "province" : "Barcelona",
    "quarter" : "les Tres Torres",
    "road" : "Carrer de Calatrava",
    "state" : "Catalonia",
    "state_code" : "CT",
    "suburb" : "Sarri\u00e0 - Sant Gervasi"        
},
At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we’ve
open-sourced the templates (https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting)we use to convert address data into well formatted strings for the 240+ territories around the world, so we know the correct answer is
Carrer de Calatrava, 66-68, 08017 Barcelona, Spain
. This is just one of many small steps we’ve taken to make developer’s lives easier.
Anyone looking for an entertaining view of the technical complexity of addresses should read “

Why is open geodata important? What's the difference between open and closed data?
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)Proprietary geodata from private services like Google are widely used, but come with licenses that severely restrict how you can use the data. Restrictions include:
don't allow storing (caching) beyond a certain time period, and require deletion when you stop being a customer
limit which maps you can use to display the geodata
require a significantly higher cost to use behind a firewall or in desktop software
no clarity on when or if data will be refreshed or corrected
Open data, like that returned by
the OpenCage geocoding API (https://opencagedata.com/), means:
store data as long as you like
display on any map
use publicly or behind a firewall
fix errors when you find them
As a final bonus, because the data is free (no cost), our service is also
much more affordable (https://opencagedata.com/reducing-your-google-geocoding-costs).
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

Investigating Social Vulnerability to Extreme Heat: Heat Islands and Climate Shelters in Urban Contexts: The Case of Bologna
A team of researchers at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento (Italy): "
n this
article (https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/14/1/17)we present three instruments: (1) a social vulnerability to extreme heat index to identify the areas of a city (and populations thereof) more vulnerable to extreme heat due to climate change (heat islands); (2) a new overall fragility index that incorporates social vulnerability to extreme heat as well as socioeconomic indicators; and (3) a climate shelter index (CSI) to identify areas within a city that can provide relief from extreme heat based on green and blue solutions. We elaborated these three indexes to measure social vulnerability to extreme heat in the municipality of Bologna, which serves as this article’s case study. By analyzing the connections between social vulnerability to extreme heat and several socio-demographic variables in Bologna, we found that a decrease in income is significantly correlated with an increase in social vulnerability to extreme heat in urban contexts. A comparison between our new overall fragility index and the existing index adopted by the municipality of Bologna (Indice di fragilità, Comune di Bologna) showed that about 75% of the statistical areas observed are worse off when social vulnerability to extreme heat is also considered. Considering social vulnerability to extreme heat shows vulnerabilities in a city (here: Bologna) that the pre-existing index did not consider. These findings and our new indexes can support the Bologna administration (and other local administrations) in addressing the consequences of climate change for their most vulnerable residents.

"
3.9 micron data from the GOES-16 East and GOES-18 West satellites on the January 2025 Southern California fires. We download the reprojected data from UW SSEC's RealEarth program. Each image is 128x128 pixels, centered at (34.1, -118.4). Each pixel is 1.0 km. The satellites measure the temperatures of the topmost infrared-opaque region in the atmosphere, which may exaggerate the extent of fires from heated smoke, or hide the extent from cloud cover. You can
see (https://github.com/xingyzt/fire)how quickly the fires initially grow — up to a square mile every minute at first — fueled by dry vegetation and strong winds. This shows the extreme difficulty of containment.

What is geocoding?
Geocoding is translating between geo coordinates (latitude, longitude) and human place descriptions (addresses, placenames, etc). There are two kinds of geocoding:
Forward geocoding
: address to coordinates
Reverse geocoding
: coordinates to address
More smart phones and tracking devices means more geodata is being created than ever before. Geocoding is a first step in processing that data into useful information.
In the coming weeks this series will look at the challenges around geocoding
.
At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we run a highly available, simple to use, worldwide, geocoding API based on open datasets like OpenStreetMap. Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

The most clicked link last week was the fascinating
Subway Stories (https://subwaystories.nyc/)(thanks Blanca!)·
AMA – Ask Me Anything
A shorter newsletter today as I'm still processing my food coma but...
it's AMA o'clock! Welcome to the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Over the past month, you've asked quite a few questions, and I can't answer all of them timely, so here's a selection. I'll try to answer them all over time, so please do keep asking your questions via this anonymous
Google form (https://forms.gle/mVJCeVLrdYmu1eJg9).
An anonymous reader asks: "
Have you joined/considered to join Kaggle competition before? Why/why not?
." I have, but as much as it might surprise some of you, I'm not really a data scientist. I'm more interested in data quality and data coverage, and sharing interesting ways to explore data, like my
Parli-N-Grams (https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/)web app. Sometimes I play with data science, but my data wrangling is relatively elementary, and I find a thrill in
discovery
more than in
competing
. My biggest strength at work is a multidisciplinary understanding of data and the ability to be a bridge between different areas of knowledge. However, I have often used Kaggle to learn what others are doing, what techniques are in and out of fashion, and, most often, simply to find interesting datasets. It's a great resource!
Allan asks: "
What are some interesting new ways that data visualizations are being used to mislead or misdirect? I'm thinking of recent additions to things like different or off Y-axis, etc.
" I'll not point the finger to a specific use, but question points to a very important problem, with the answer being, obviously, "it depends". For example, it makes me think about the debate within the dataviz community about whether it's correct/ethical to cut off the Y-axis. This is the practice of making a chart with a Y-axis that doesn't start at 0, but closer to a value that somewhat highlights the phenomenon that the chart is exploring. This problem had some coverage, for example on the
ONS blog (https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2016/06/27/does-the-axis-have-to-start-at-zero-part-1-line-charts/)(about 8 years ago), with the chart below given as example: "
At this zoom level there looks to be a marked decline and subsequent rise in the data. But is this important or not? Some context might be useful to make sense of this trend.
"
And there it goes: every use of data can be misleading if it doesn't capture the context in which the data was captured and used. In dataviz, which is by nature a summary of a complex reality, this can happen often.
Jez sends an OpenStreetMap question: "
OpenStreetMap, perhaps the most valuable Open database in the world, was created in the UK. How would you raise its profile with UK Government and/or with citizens?
" Oh, this is a beautiful one, and it's a blank canvas to answer :-) First of all, you'd be surprised: as someone who works in Government, I've seen plenty of uses of OSM when presenting geographic data. It's often appreciated by us in the public sector because of its coverage and timeliness of updates. However, it is also true that Ordnance Survey is another treasure of geo-data, especially in Great Britain, and that it comes with some official status – in Government, we can use the full spectrum of Ordnance Survey data thanks to the permissive
PSGA licence (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/customers/public-sector/public-sector-licensing). It's all good competition for the best geodataset. So, in all honesty, I would expect OSM to be more popular with
other
Governments. I have seen some pretty large organisations using it, some of which are listed on the
OSM website (https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/about-osm-community/consumers/)and include the
Italian's Prime Minister's office (https://www.governo.it/it/mappa-del-presidente),  the
Scottish Government's crime report maps (https://datamap-scotland.co.uk/scotland-reported-crime-data/city-of-edinburgh-council-ward-crime-map/), and the
World Bank's project map (https://maps.worldbank.org/)screenshotted below. I'd say that many international organisation are fully aware and use OSM effectively.
Things are different when we talk about the general public, though, because in this cohort success is all about ease of use for navigation – the ability of getting turn-by-turn directions on loudspeaker, for example, is what ultimately drives people to Google or Apple maps. While there are now great apps that offer services like this using OpenStreetMap data (such as
Maps.Me (https://maps.me/)) these are still limited in terms of features and somewhat clunky for the average user. OpenStreetMap doesn't want – and rightly so – to provide a single way of using its data; it's a data source, rather than a map provider, so I suspect that it will never be fully appreciated by the general public as if it did.
Finally, an anonymous reader asks me a personal question about Quantum: "
Are you able to monetize your newsletter enough to justify the time you spend on it? If yes, how long did it take to achieve monetization? If no, why do you still write it?
". Ha, I'm not a newsletter millionaire (for now? :P). While I have occasional sponsors, and accept donations, at the moment I am not looking to massively monetise this newsletter. I've had enough sponsorships and donors over the past 12 years that allow me to cover the server costs, and that's as much as I'm happy to push (things might change one day).
The reason why I write Quantum is not to run a business. For me, it's a tool to distil things I've seen that caught my interest, learn something from it, understand myself and my evolving interests, and building networks and relationships. It gives me joy, and it has allowed me to get in touch with many interesting data folks. There are also indirect benefits, some financial and some non-financial – for example, readers of this newsletter asked me to
freelance (https://puntofisso.medium.com/my-report-on-best-practice-for-local-data-initiatives-313d12f83865)for them, or invited me to speak at their conferences, flying me to Buenos Aires for
csv,conf (https://puntofisso.net/csvconf2023)or Madrid for
TRGCON (https://puntofisso.net/trgcon24/).

Of all the articles I've read and linked to in 2024, one keeps making my brain explode every time I think of it (and, for some reason, I keep thinking of it): "
How to date a recording using background electrical noise (https://robertheaton.com/enf/)" by Robert Heaton. It's very technical and I only understand parts of it. The TL;DR: to prove that a suspect was guilty, the police used a recording, not for the content of the recording but because the "hum" sound in the recording, from electrical interference, matched the frequency of the hum of the electrical network at a certain specific time and place. What's remarkable, aside from the CSI technique, is that such frequency data is openly available throughout most of the developed world.

(via Lucilla Piccari)Which chart types did our users create in 2024?
Rose Mintzer-Sweeney
wraps up (https://blog.datawrapper.de/popular-chart-types-2024/)the year for Datawrapper.
Retirement age vs Life expectancy
One I made. I was looking at the relationship between retirement age and life expectancy, something that was sparked by a conversation at work. Using data from
Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_age)and the
WHO (https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688), I created this
chart (https://www.datawrapper.de/_/oWrIp/). However, there are some caveats that need to be understood: retirement age is for many countries not a fixed date. It changes with age, it will be changing over the next few years, and there are intricate rules almost everywhere. So here I usually captured the earliest date, or the most common date. Dataviz of this kind is hard, but I hope this gives something to think about – especially those countries that seem to have very close retirement age and life expectancy.
Feel free to share, but do share with these caveats if you do.

For example: content that's not zoomable, interaction that's not available for keyboard users, insights that don't get communicated to screen reader users, lacking text alternatives, semantic errors, or missing explanations.
This time I also ran axe DevTools at the end of the review, which picked up between 3 (NRK) and 62 (Fox News) errors against WCAG 2.1. When including tests against best practices, a total of 870 issues were found on Fox News, 206 on the Washington Post, 24 on Reuters, and 70 on NRK.

#586: quantum of sollazzo – 3 December 2024
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.

It's AMA o'clock! This is the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Here we are at the second edition of my Ask Me Anything. I think I will keep things this way: I'll let the questions come in for a few weeks, and answer them once a month.
Cole asks me: "What do you think are the greatest opportunities for business researchers in the age of generative AI? Where do you think algorithmic understanding can complement social scientific understanding (and vice-versa)". While we could fill pages trying to answer this question from a philosophical point of view (which I'm not very good at...), I'll give my pragmatic angle (which I'm usually good at...): if we consider generative AI as a tool, it can be transformative as many tools have in the past: the wheel, the hammer, the typewriter, the Internet; all these tool can be and should be mastered in order to be used effectively and safely. I've recently tried using Claude to help on a coding mission; it made me probably ten times faster than if I had started coding from scratch, but it still helped massively that I have coding knowledge, I could spot Claude's errors, re-prompt it (him?) to reformulate, and refactor the code manually. This is how I see AI, any form of AI whether generative or otherwise, and this is where it is proving the real, most ground-breaking impact: not by creating black-boxes that win games – although this is exciting and mind-blowing – but where it augments and speeds up the creativity of human researchers. This is the use that, fundamentally, had led to a Nobel Prize this year. I've seen some of this first-hand when working in the NHS AI Lab: we did a
project with Parkinsons UK (https://transform.england.nhs.uk/ai-lab/explore-all-resources/develop-ai/identifying-and-quantifying-parkinsons-disease-using-ai-on-brain-slices/)which, in just 6 months, created a neural network able to detect Parkinson's Disease in brain slice images, making the work of pathologists 10x faster. This is what I thing of generative AI: a good tool in the right, trained hands.
Duncan asks: "What is the hardest problem in data visualisation?". Beautiful question :) So let me take you through a short story. Here's a slide from my
talk at TRGCON (https://puntofisso.net/trgcon24/):
On this slide, you see two pictures capturing the result of the general election 2018 in Italy through the use of the official electoral data. The one on the left is a beautiful picture made by the very excellent team at the Financial Times. It illustrated an article, which described Italy as a country divided in three, making it very evident that the country is, indeed, divided in three parts. They created this map in the most common way: by showing the colour of the winning party in each constituency.
But look at the map on the right. It's ugly because, erm, I made it, and I'm not the best at graphics. This is a dot map: I show 10,000 votes per party wherever they fall. I used this map to illustrate my story: 2018 Italy is a country that is politically confused.
So, there you have it: two maps that are created using the same data, but tell an entirely different story. You might ask: which one is true? Was Italy in 2018 a divided country or a confused country? Well, to an extent, it was both - and there lies my answer to Duncan. Data visualization always has its own
agenda
. An agenda is not evil by nature: it's just the consequence of the choices we make when we collect and use data (in this case, both the FT team and I had only control on the latter, obviously). These choices give any data visualization a "spin", and for many data visualization practitioners it's hard to come up to terms with this. A data-driven visualization is not neutral. Data is never neutral. Understanding this is the hardest problem in data visualization.
This brings me to a bunch of slightly... provocative questions, which are from Alex, Lucilla, and a few others, who ask me about working in the public sector. I won't say who asks what, but they are all very similar about "what's the worst/most bizarre/most frustrating thing working in the UK public sector". Well, let me tell you first that I very deliberately choose to move into the public sector :) I did so because there's not many other areas where you can use data to have an impact on the lives of million of people, and I find that incredibly exciting. For example, one of my teams looks after the data engine that powers the UK Electoral Roll - that's data about tens of millions of people, checked regularly, that enables the exercise of democracy in our country. Every role, every organisation will have issues of all sorts – after a number of years you either can't face them any longer, and move, or learn to navigate them, work around them, maybe even seeing them as part of a whole. A bit like a long marriage. That applies to pretty much every type of organisation. Working in the public sector is no different.

Tips for data entry in Excel
Believe me, you might need
this tutorial (https://cghlewis.com/blog/excel_entry/)at some point :-)"
Research projects often involve some form of data entry. Even if you’re not collecting paper forms that require your team to manually enter the responses (e.g., paper surveys collected in the field need to be manually entered), you’re often still entering some sort of internal record keeping information (e.g., who are our consented participants, what is their contact information, what are their assigned study IDs, what data have we collected on them). There are many reasons that it is typically preferred to enter this information into a database management system (e.g., FileMaker, Microsoft Access, Airtable, LibreOffice Base, Quick Base) as opposed to a spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel. While both spreadsheets and databases hold tabular data, there are several benefits to entering data into a database as opposed to a spreadsheet.

#584: quantum of sollazzo – 19 November 2024
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
It's a shorter issue this time as I was away for TRGCON and my brain was all focussed on rehearsing my talk – back to normal service next week.
·
The most clicked link last week was Count.com's
introduction to metric trees (https://count.co/blog/intro-to-metric-trees).

I'm just back from TRGCON '24 and it was one of the best things I've done in my life!
"Todo es posible" is the motto of
TRGCON (https://trgcon.com/)— everything is possible.
When David Bonilla reached out to invite me to give a talk at TRGCON '24, an event I had never heard of, my first reactions were: "is this a really good scam attempt?" and "have they reached out to the wrong Giuseppe?". Man, how wrong I was. The reality: total serendipity. I had been lucky to be found by someone totally outside of my "bubble". As I'm about to fly back to London after an AMAZING event where I literally didn't know anyone, my brain is still buzzing and my heart is very full.
I was a bit terrified of speaking to this 700+ audience at an event that was exclusively in Spanish – mine was one of the only two talks at the event to be in English. The terror turned out to be excitement. I'll post more about my talk later, and a video will be published soon, but, in short I shared a few stories about data that have taught me something, and discussed how these lessons became part of my personal "framework" to be effective using data, whether I'm developing data pipelines, advocating for better data, or using data to back an argument with evidence. I discussed how Agile helps us working in the UK Government run things smoothly, and how the Gov.Uk Service Standard is a brilliant resource to ask ourselves if we're doing things right, to verify we're serving the right user needs, to assure the services we're creating are reliable, maintainable, and sustainable. I shared my view that data is the ultimate multidisciplinary area of knowledge.
Despite my very limited Spanish, I managed to follow and be inspired by the other talks. How not to praise enough
Clara Jiménez Cruz (https://x.com/cjimenezcruz)on her brilliant work and talk on misinformation and fact-checking, something that is close to my heart and with important connotations about public trust, an important topic for us in public service;
Trisha Gee (https://trishagee.com/)spoke about how to set up DevRel as something that can sit anywhere in an corporate organisation, which resonates a lot with the efforts I've always made to turn data into a service to the organisations I work with, a journey with and for colleagues, not something done to them; and Rafael Pons Fedelich speaking on the challenges he's found in launching
a popular mobile app (https://www.photopills.com/)– a reality check for those of us who complain about things being "slow" in Government and "fast" in the startup world (the grass is always greener etc...)I'm really humbled of having been part of this all – an outstanding conference to be inspired from, a new community of makers to learn from, and a good reminder that... I should try and learn Spanish!

@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso)✨ Topical (yes, there was an election)US Presidential Election Results
"
Bloomberg News is
reporting live election results (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-us-election-results/)in the presidential race between Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and her Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump.
"
Some pretty good charts.
Partisan Investing
Not quite my usual source, but I found
this article (https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/partisan-investing)rather interesting and well argued: "
In today’s polarized climate, partisan politics pose a major challenge for investors, especially around elections. We identify “Democratic” and “Republican” stocks based on their political contributions. While such contributions generally represent profitable “investments in influence,” highly partisan donations, particularly from executives, have generated limited shareholder returns. In contrast, “nonpartisan stocks,” which invest in diversified portfolios of candidates from both parties, have delivered excess returns with lower political risk.
"
It also offers a historical perspective.
How early risers, gossip-spreaders, UFO-seers and more lean in the presidential election
YouGov: "
YouGov's extensive
compilation (https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50868-how-early-risers-gossip-spreaders-ufo-seers-and-more-lean-in-the-presidential-election)of polls from recent months captures the expected and unexpected ways that Americans are split over the 2024 election. Harris does better with atheists, renters, and people with college degrees — and also with people who like to see movies in theaters or to sleep in. Trump does better with people who are Protestant, married, or live in rural areas — and also with people who have been in a car crash or think they've seen a UFO.
"
And I'm a total sucker for a good log odds chart.

London-based Charity Climate Policy Radar have released the
full text data of all their documents (https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimatePolicyRadar/all-document-text-data)as open data.

#582: quantum of sollazzo – 5 November 2024
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week.

Color Buddy app (https://color-buddy.netlify.app/).
·
It's AMA o'clock! Ask Me Anything.
Here's the first set of answers to the questions you've asked – I've started receiving an interesting collection of questions about data, about my job, and quite a few fun jokes (I know who you are...). I'll answer more in the next few issues :)Rares Ciurezu asks me this very interesting, deeply technical question: "
What is the best way to present INRIX Travel Time Journey Data for motorized vehicles? I have a large dataset that contains thousands of links and data at 15-minute intervals from GPS data. Is there a best practice guide I can use?
"
Now, I'm not an expert in the direct use of INRIX data, but I have a couple of hints. First of all, for the uninitiated, INRIX is a provider of transport data. Their data is
available (https://docs.inrix.com/datadownload/datadownload/)and, while not open data, it's widely used within both the public and private sector and my colleagues at the Department for Transport mentioned it many times. This question makes me think of two potential places to start looking at.
First of all, the
Charting Transport (https://chartingtransport.com/)blog by transport geek Chris Loader offers many visualizations of traffic data, centred in Australia, and could provide a few ideas.
Secondly, the way Rares describes the data as a combination of regular intervals and location makes me think that it might be a good fit for a Marey diagram.
If you have never heard of Marey diagrams, they are an amazing tool to explore how regular or irregular public transit is. They were invented by French scientist
Étienne-Jules Marey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey)and have been applied to, for example,
buses in Sydney (https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/11/visualising-sydney-bus-congestion-with-marey-charts/)and the
metro in New York City (https://mbtaviz.github.io/)– the latter is where the screenshot below comes from. Maybe an option for the INRIX data is to consider, instead of individual cars, groups of cars – for example, all cars that start their trip between 10:30-10:40, or other groups calculated with some form of clustering.
Morten Lind asks: "
What is correct: Data are or data is?
" – probably knowing he won't get a straight answer from me :D In fact, I asked this exact questions to about 50 data gurus I interviewed in Quantum of Sollazzo (you can find these in the
archive (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/), starting from
issue 420 (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/archive/420-quantum-of-sollazzo/)).
You will find that many will say that the correct form would be "data are"... except the way we refer to data today as a collective noun makes "data is" more appealing. And that's more or less what I end up doing – I say "data is" because it sounds better.
As Jeremy Singer-Vine (
issue 421 (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/archive/421-quantum-of-sollazzo/)) made me realise, there is an interesting
historical analysis (https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph)of this, thanks to Google Books Ngram Viewer.
Or you can do what Sam Joiner suggested in
issue 445 (https://buttondown.com/puntofisso/archive/445-quantum-of-sollazzo/)and avoid the problem at all by saying "the data analysis", "the dataset", etc...
Finally, Guy asks me "
Why are your jokes so bad?
". They are, indeed they are. Bad puns and dad jokes have become part of my "brand", haven't they? Well, my theory is: if people don't run away after being repeated inflicted my terrible jokes, we can discuss more difficult topics...
You can send me a question

Questionable practices in machine learning
Academic
paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12220)klaxon: "
Evaluating modern ML models is hard. The strong incentive for researchers and companies to report a state-of-the-art result on some metric often leads to questionable research practices (QRPs): bad practices which fall short of outright research fraud. We describe 43 such practices which can undermine reported results, giving examples where possible. Our list emphasises the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on public benchmarks. We also discuss "irreproducible research practices", i.e. decisions that make it difficult or impossible for other researchers to reproduce, build on or audit previous research.

For those who don't know, "conbini" or "konbini" is the name of the pervasive, small convenience stores (the word "conbini" coming from the way "convenience" is pronounced in Japan) that you can find in Japan, notorious for stocking a lot of useful items, food, drinks, and offering free WiFi. There are many chains, among which I thought  7-Eleven was the most popular.
The author says: "
In my neighborhood there is seemingly only Lawson
conbinis (https://conbini.kikkia.dev/). This led me to take a look at how common these pockets of exclusive territory are.

Upward Mobility Data Dashboard
The Urban Institute: "
The
dashboard (https://upward-mobility.urban.org/dashboard)provides Mobility Metrics data for 24 predictors. The predictors are indicators that are strongly associated with upward mobility, according to the Upward Mobility Framework’s three-part definition of the term that encompasses long-term economic success, dignity and belonging, and power and autonomy. The predictors fall within one of five pillars, which represent supports people need from their communities to achieve upward mobility.

How to date a recording using background electrical noise
Rather geeky and tangentially data, but really worth a read, by Robert Heaton. The key
concept (https://robertheaton.com/enf/)to understand is that the mains electricity, which provides AC – Alternate Current – alternates between different voltages at a given frequency. While this is usually reported as 50 Hz, it is in fact oscillating between different frequencies in an established pattern which varies from time to time. This can give a hint as to when a recording was made, if it did capture the "hum" of electric interference. Source code is also provided
here (https://github.com/robert/enf-matching).
Oh, and by the way, Fourier Transforms are an amazing tool.

Olympics 100m
The Olympics 100m really captured everyone's attention – I received multiple tips about the excellent use of data visualization for the Olympics 100m race. Starting with the dataviz-heavy
BBC coverage (https://www.youtube.com/watch), for example.
Marco Cortella gave me a heads-up about
the work by Intel (https://twitter.com/AshtonJEaton/status/1820220135786836025).
This one by World Athletics (https://x.com/WorldAthletics/status/1820218219480715472)is pretty beautiful (but rather confusing – I get what they were trying to do, but I'm none the wiser about how the race went).
Speaking of the Olympics, Guy Lipman sent me
this blog post (https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2024/08/13/gold-medal-for-nyts-data-viz/)that analyses the brilliant choice made by the New York Times when visualising the ranking by medals.

In this effort, how the information is displayed, propagated and relayed between clinical teams and leadership is as (if not more) important than the shear goal of accurate risk estimation (according to statistical metrics).

35% Faster Than The Filesystem
This is what SQLite now
claims (https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html)to be. I've got to say I increasingly use it in my personal projects, when they don't need frequent, concurrent writes.
"
SQLite reads and writes small blobs (for example, thumbnail images) 35% faster¹ than the same blobs can be read from or written to individual files on disk using fread() or fwrite().
Furthermore, a single SQLite database holding 10-kilobyte blobs uses about 20% less disk space than storing the blobs in individual files.
The performance difference arises (we believe) because when working from an SQLite database, the open() and close() system calls are invoked only once, whereas open() and close() are invoked once for each blob when using blobs stored in individual files. It appears that the overhead of calling open() and close() is greater than the overhead of using the database. The size reduction arises from the fact that individual files are padded out to the next multiple of the filesystem block size, whereas the blobs are packed more tightly into an SQLite database.
The measurements in this article were made during the week of 2017-06-05 using a version of SQLite in between 3.19.2 and 3.20.0. You may expect future versions of SQLite to perform even better.

Evaluating modern ML models is hard.

We describe 43 such practices which can undermine reported results, giving examples where possible.
Our list (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12220)emphasises the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on public benchmarks. We also discuss "irreproducible research practices", i.e. decisions that make it difficult or impossible for other researchers to reproduce, build on or audit previous research.

Every map of China is wrong
Well, not quite, but catchy title :-) I didn't know about the "
China GPS shift (https://medium.com/@anastasia.bizyayeva/every-map-of-china-is-wrong-bc2bce145db2)" and it was very interesting to learn about. This seems to be a national security decision, which boils down to the fact that "
companies outside of China need to have a Chinese mapping partner in order to provide data about Chinese locations.
"
Most notably, it seems to cause a misalignment between Google Maps and Google StreetView, and it's a reminder that geospatial data is not easy to understand and interpret without knowledge of geography, history, and politics.

How children starve
Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/GAZA-HUNGER/myvmakwxrvr/)takes a look at the impact of famine.

What to do with age? Linear, Discrete, Both, or Spline
Academic Vincent Arel-Bundock writes: "
In a blog post, Andrew Gelman (2024) relays this question:
“The subgroups they examine are 65-74 years old, 75-84, and >85. I’ve seen these types of binning common in medical studies. But why? The actual ages are certainly known, so why not treat age as a continuous variable?”
Gelman’s answer is:
“Discrete binning isn’t perfect, but it’s transparent and can be better than a simple linear model.”
The
idea (https://arelbundock.com/posts/age_linear_discrete/age_linear_discrete.html)is that fitting a model with multiple coefficients associated with bin-specific binary variables allows more flexibility than a model where age is entered purely linearly, with a single coefficient. The downsides of this strategy are that binning “wastes” information by coarsening a fine-grained measure and that the cutpoints of the age bins can sometimes feel arbitrary.
As Gelman notes, however, analysts can get the best of both worlds by including age as both a set of bins and as a single continuous variable.

(via Durand D'souza)ChatGPT is bullshit
"
Recently, there has been considerable interest in large language models: machine learning systems which produce human-like text and dialogue. Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.

Flow Charts with CSS Anchor Positioning
Cory Rylan: "
With the introduction of the CSS Anchor Position API in Chrome 125, it's never been easier to position an element relative to another element. This is a great way to manage complex positioning use cases like popovers and tooltips.
However, CSS Anchor Positioning can be used for more than just popovers and tooltips, it can be used to
create basic flow chart diagrams (https://coryrylan.com/blog/flow-charts-with-css-anchor-positioning). In this post we will learn how to use CSS Anchor Positioning to create flow charts and diagram with just CSS.

You're Collecting Too Much Data!

The most instinctive reaction to wanting data is to collect and store as much of it as you can, figure it out later. For many reasons, that's probably a
bad idea (https://www.counting-stuff.com/youre-collecting-too-much-data/).
"
I've seen a few of articles recently that fundamentally address the same question: of all the promises of big data, very few use cases have actually seen success. This is either because there wasn't, in fact, data that was so big to begin with, or that regardless of how big the data is (are? :P), any analysis is only useful for a tiny subset.

Most of them simulate data according to the rules of a model, plot the simulated data, and report statistical results obtained by fitting the simulated data to the model from which they were generated.   The user can adjust values of model parameters or change features of the model, then see what happens to the plotted data and to the statistical results.   Most apps have an option to change the random seed, which will generate a new (pseudo-) random set of data.

BIG DATA IS DEAD

For more than a decade now, the fact that people have a hard time gaining actionable insights from their data has been blamed on its size. “Your data is too big for your puny systems,” was the diagnosis, and the cure was to buy some new fancy technology that can handle massive scale. Of course, after the Big Data task force purchased all new tooling and migrated from Legacy systems, people found that they still were having trouble making sense of their data.

data size wasn’t really the problem at all (https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/).

Nerd, tech, and with a hint of Bologna, you say? Well, that's basically me, so let me link you to this
project (https://diumari.com/pages/campionato)by Spencer Wright (founder of Scope of Work / formerly The Prepared, which I've occasionally linked to), "
Il Campionato Mondiale di  Umari
".
Here's what it is: "
Umari is the plural form of umarell, and umarell is a jocular Italian term for a person – classically a man of retirement age – who pauses to observe work in progress. The term might be used as light-hearted mockery in Italy, but we think more people ought to umarell; this website is dedicated to that effort.
To umarell is to take an interest in the built environment – this world we move through that our species created, in which most of us spend most of our time. Our lives turn the city into a grey blur, a backdrop to our transits, an obstacle course to negotiate. This is a shame.
Buildings are the redwoods of our time: We’re surrounded by them, they tower over us, and nearly every building you see will be standing long after you’re gone. They ought to be a source of awe and wonder, as much as mountains are, or birds. They’re just as easy to ignore, because they’re so commonplace, and initially offer nothing to hold our attention. But attention is fractal – if you wake up to the city, the city will awaken around you.
We hope you’ll give it a try.

Minority genders in quantitative survey research: a data-driven approach to clear, inclusive, and accurate gender questions
Academic paper (https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingvan-2023-0025/html)KLAXON: "
Whilst linguistic research on speakers of minority genders has increased in the past decade, much less is known about how they can best be included in broader (socio)linguistic research. The current paper compares the way a range of five different gender measures for survey research are filled out and evaluated by a sample of LGBTQ+ people (N = 682). It finds that providing a larger range of answering options allows researchers to gain a better view of the gender diversity in their sample, whilst preventing refusals and loss of participants. The gender question that was least likely to be refused and was rated the most accurate, most inclusive, and clearest was a six-option multiple-choice question which included a “prefer not to say” and a write-in option. This question reconciles two competing interests in the treatment of queer data: it explicitly recognizes and names minority genders and simultaneously carves out space for participants to refuse categorization or write out gender identities beyond those preset by the researcher.

It tracks discrete product and project launches, not just organizations. The data consists of categorized project launch dates, not end dates, so we’re not exploring project longevity here.We’ve broadly divided the collection up between the tech (products, apps, websites) and the social (everything that people do: the conferences, funders, meetups of civic tech). We also track adjacent and foundational projects that aren’t explicitly civic tech, but are necessary for civic tech to have meaning: issues like broadly available internet connectivity and racial, gender, and linguistic diversity online.

Correlation vs. Regression: A Key Difference That Many Analysts Miss

Correlation and regression (https://medium.com/the-stata-gallery/correlation-vs-regression-a-key-difference-that-many-analysts-miss-3770c9b368d9)have many similarities and can often both be applied to the same data.

Sponsorship news
As of last week, I've announced to my Github sponsors that I'm ceasing to accept sponsorship for this newsletter. This is the consequence of a few reflections, including the fact that I never intended to run this newsletter as a "for profit" initiative, and patronage was originally a way to pay the expenses and create a community around the newsletter.
But with my day job keeping me too busy to invest more time in the community and the occasional commercial sponsor, as well as the many opportunities that this newsletter has opened up for me, I decided it was time to let go of formal patronage (occasional relevant ads might still appear).
A huge thank you to everyone who sponsored Quantum – some have gone on for years.
If you like an issue, you can always

Trees for Quantum
Speaking of sponsorship, I used last month's donations to...
plant trees (https://treesforlife.org.uk/groves/496858/):-)I started a grove dedicated to Quantum and the plan is to grow it with part of the donations/coffees/sponsorship money. I'll keep you posted as it grows, and you are very much welcome to add trees to it directly.

What Great Data Analysts Do — and Why Every Organization Needs Them
A big cheer for data analysts (https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them).
"
“Full-stack” data scientist means mastery of machine learning, statistics, and analytics. Today’s fashion in data science favors flashy sophistication with a dash of sci-fi, making AI and machine learning the darlings of the job market. Alternative challengers for the alpha spot come from statistics, thanks to a century-long reputation for rigor and mathematical superiority. What about analysts?Whereas excellence in statistics is about rigor and excellence in machine learning is about performance, excellence in analytics is all about speed. Analysts are your best bet for coming up with those hypotheses in the first place. As analysts mature, they’ll begin to get the hang of judging what’s important in addition to what’s interesting, allowing decision-makers to step away from the middleman role. Of the three breeds, analysts are the most likely heirs to the decision throne.
"
Interestingly, I think that "data analyst" as a job title has gone out of fashion for many (wrong) reasons, or it has become associated with clerical or financial roles that are often unappealing to the data crowd. And yet, it's a label that I often find pretty descriptive about what many data workers actually do in their job.

How to use PostgreSQL for (military) geoanalytics tasks
"
In this article, I will discuss how to use PostgreSQL to process geospatial data and address common geoanalytical tasks. The information will cover methods for finding the nearest objects, distance calculations, and using geospatial indexes to enhance these processes. We will also explore techniques for determining a point within a polygon and geospatial aggregation.

Why Line Chart Baselines Can Start at Non-Zero
Nathan Yau (FlowingData)'s opinion
here (https://flowingdata.com/2024/03/06/line-chart-baselines/): "
There is a recurring argument that line chart baselines must start at zero, because anything else would be misleading, dishonest, and an insult to all that is good in the world. The critique is misguided.

I'd say: "it depends".

Which crops have the most potential in a changing climate?
"
The Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS) is a global movement that aims to foster more resilient food systems by focusing on the fundamentals of food security: climate-adapted crops and healthy soils. Initially launched by the U.S. Department of State, the African Union, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, VACS seeks to boost agricultural productivity and nutrition by developing diverse, climate-resilient crop varieties and building healthy soils. VACS provides a unified investment framework for stakeholders to advance these goals. VACS is working with AgMIP to develop a models of future crop productivity that will help identify the most promising crops for a changing climate.
This application (https://vacs.theplotline.org/)visualizes initial results of these models.

🤖 AI
The real quandary of AI isn’t what people think
Tim Harford (https://timharford.com/2024/03/the-real-quandary-of-ai-isnt-what-people-think/): "
Unlike with generative AI, anybody with a pen, paper and three minutes to spare can write a list of what they do better with a smartphone in hand, and what they do better when the smartphone is out of sight. The challenge is to remember that list and act accordingly. The smartphone is a powerful tool that most of us unthinkingly misuse many times a day, despite the fact that it is far less mysterious than a large language model like GPT-4. Will we really do a better job with the AI tools to come?

Fine particles in the air: Ljubljana among the most polluted European cities
From the European Data Journalism network: "
Fine particle pollution (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/fine-particles-in-the-air-ljubljana-among-the-most-polluted-european-cities/)causes premature births, illness, and, in Slovenia, more than 800 preventable deaths every year.
"
I remember looking into this quite a bit when I moved from Bologna to London. I'm not sure if this is still the case, but in the mid-2000s Bologna used to have a level of fine particles that was way over that of London, probably caused by the almost total lack of wind and the topography of the hills surrounding the town. The feeling of choking was common.
Are Americans moving on from dairy?
USA Facts: "
Milk production in the US has almost
doubled (https://usafacts.org/articles/are-americans-moving-on-from-dairy/)since 1975, but people drink nearly half as much milk as back then.

I suppose some of this is because cheese has had a resurgence in how fashionable it is, and yogurt has become a staple – rightly or not – of healthier diets.

New tools, processes, stakeholders in every part of the business, entrenched beliefs and opinions, and unspoken expectations. The things that make it difficult to begin as a Head of Data are the same things that make it difficult to thrive as a Head of Data.

"
I'm working on a revamp of an old
project (https://mary.codes/blog/programming/translating_openstreetmaps_to_HTML5_canvas_rust_wasm/)of mine called Line Buddy (github). It used a now-deprecated API library called themeparks (github) and A-Frame to visually represent the wait times in the Disney World theme parks in 3D.
The original project used OpenStreetMap screenshots as the base, with columns representing the wait times. (They're all zero now since this version of the API no longer works.)My plan is to use OpenStreetMap data to create a simplified version of the map. Eventually, I'll create the map in 3D. As a proof of concept, however, I'm going to draw to an HTML5 canvas first. I want to make sure that I'm able to get the data that I need, process it, and use it to create my own maps.

#590: quantum of sollazzo – 31 Dec 2024
The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
·
The most clicked link last week was the fascinating
Subway Stories (https://subwaystories.nyc/)(thanks Blanca!)·
AMA – Ask Me Anything
A shorter newsletter today as I'm still processing my food coma but...
it's AMA o'clock! Welcome to the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Over the past month, you've asked quite a few questions, and I can't answer all of them timely, so here's a selection. I'll try to answer them all over time, so please do keep asking your questions via this anonymous
Google form (https://forms.gle/mVJCeVLrdYmu1eJg9).
An anonymous reader asks: "
Have you joined/considered to join Kaggle competition before? Why/why not?
." I have, but as much as it might surprise some of you, I'm not really a data scientist. I'm more interested in data quality and data coverage, and sharing interesting ways to explore data, like my
Parli-N-Grams (https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/)web app. Sometimes I play with data science, but my data wrangling is relatively elementary, and I find a thrill in
discovery
more than in
competing
. My biggest strength at work is a multidisciplinary understanding of data and the ability to be a bridge between different areas of knowledge. However, I have often used Kaggle to learn what others are doing, what techniques are in and out of fashion, and, most often, simply to find interesting datasets. It's a great resource!
Allan asks: "
What are some interesting new ways that data visualizations are being used to mislead or misdirect? I'm thinking of recent additions to things like different or off Y-axis, etc.
" I'll not point the finger to a specific use, but question points to a very important problem, with the answer being, obviously, "it depends". For example, it makes me think about the debate within the dataviz community about whether it's correct/ethical to cut off the Y-axis. This is the practice of making a chart with a Y-axis that doesn't start at 0, but closer to a value that somewhat highlights the phenomenon that the chart is exploring. This problem had some coverage, for example on the
ONS blog (https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2016/06/27/does-the-axis-have-to-start-at-zero-part-1-line-charts/)(about 8 years ago), with the chart below given as example: "
At this zoom level there looks to be a marked decline and subsequent rise in the data. But is this important or not? Some context might be useful to make sense of this trend.
"
And there it goes: every use of data can be misleading if it doesn't capture the context in which the data was captured and used. In dataviz, which is by nature a summary of a complex reality, this can happen often.
Jez sends an OpenStreetMap question: "
OpenStreetMap, perhaps the most valuable Open database in the world, was created in the UK. How would you raise its profile with UK Government and/or with citizens?
" Oh, this is a beautiful one, and it's a blank canvas to answer :-) First of all, you'd be surprised: as someone who works in Government, I've seen plenty of uses of OSM when presenting geographic data. It's often appreciated by us in the public sector because of its coverage and timeliness of updates. However, it is also true that Ordnance Survey is another treasure of geo-data, especially in Great Britain, and that it comes with some official status – in Government, we can use the full spectrum of Ordnance Survey data thanks to the permissive
PSGA licence (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/customers/public-sector/public-sector-licensing). It's all good competition for the best geodataset. So, in all honesty, I would expect OSM to be more popular with
other
Governments. I have seen some pretty large organisations using it, some of which are listed on the
OSM website (https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/about-osm-community/consumers/)and include the
Italian's Prime Minister's office (https://www.governo.it/it/mappa-del-presidente),  the
Scottish Government's crime report maps (https://datamap-scotland.co.uk/scotland-reported-crime-data/city-of-edinburgh-council-ward-crime-map/), and the
World Bank's project map (https://maps.worldbank.org/)screenshotted below. I'd say that many international organisation are fully aware and use OSM effectively.
Things are different when we talk about the general public, though, because in this cohort success is all about ease of use for navigation – the ability of getting turn-by-turn directions on loudspeaker, for example, is what ultimately drives people to Google or Apple maps. While there are now great apps that offer services like this using OpenStreetMap data (such as
Maps.Me (https://maps.me/)) these are still limited in terms of features and somewhat clunky for the average user. OpenStreetMap doesn't want – and rightly so – to provide a single way of using its data; it's a data source, rather than a map provider, so I suspect that it will never be fully appreciated by the general public as if it did.
Finally, an anonymous reader asks me a personal question about Quantum: "
Are you able to monetize your newsletter enough to justify the time you spend on it? If yes, how long did it take to achieve monetization? If no, why do you still write it?
". Ha, I'm not a newsletter millionaire (for now? :P). While I have occasional sponsors, and accept donations, at the moment I am not looking to massively monetise this newsletter. I've had enough sponsorships and donors over the past 12 years that allow me to cover the server costs, and that's as much as I'm happy to push (things might change one day).
The reason why I write Quantum is not to run a business. For me, it's a tool to distil things I've seen that caught my interest, learn something from it, understand myself and my evolving interests, and building networks and relationships. It gives me joy, and it has allowed me to get in touch with many interesting data folks. There are also indirect benefits, some financial and some non-financial – for example, readers of this newsletter asked me to
freelance (https://puntofisso.medium.com/my-report-on-best-practice-for-local-data-initiatives-313d12f83865)for them, or invited me to speak at their conferences, flying me to Buenos Aires for
csv,conf (https://puntofisso.net/csvconf2023)or Madrid for
TRGCON (https://puntofisso.net/trgcon24/).

In this
episode (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6V58X1GkGmh2J0Luov41nt)of It's Not All About the Numbers, Chris and Mike welcome back Giuseppe Sollazzo, Deputy Director of Data Enablement at DWP, for a lively chat on data quality, teamwork, and the future of work. Giuseppe shares lessons from his speaking gigs, along with fresh takes on financial success, online habits, and communicating data effectively. Packed with anecdotes, humour, and sharp insights, this episode is a must-listen for anyone navigating the data and tech world.
"
·
Of all the articles I've read and linked to in 2024, one keeps making my brain explode every time I think of it (and, for some reason, I keep thinking of it): "
How to date a recording using background electrical noise (https://robertheaton.com/enf/)" by Robert Heaton. It's very technical and I only understand parts of it. The TL;DR: to prove that a suspect was guilty, the police used a recording, not for the content of the recording but because the "hum" sound in the recording, from electrical interference, matched the frequency of the hum of the electrical network at a certain specific time and place. What's remarkable, aside from the CSI technique, is that such frequency data is openly available throughout most of the developed world.
'till next week and happy new year,
Giuseppe

Snow (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-christmas-snow-data)on Christmas Day is idyllic for many. And in recent years, most of the US have seen a “white Christmas.” But many parts of the country haven’t had snow on the ground on Dec. 25 in more than a decade.

(via Lucilla Piccari)Which chart types did our users create in 2024?
Rose Mintzer-Sweeney
wraps up (https://blog.datawrapper.de/popular-chart-types-2024/)the year for Datawrapper.
Retirement age vs Life expectancy
One I made. I was looking at the relationship between retirement age and life expectancy, something that was sparked by a conversation at work. Using data from
Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_age)and the
WHO (https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688), I created this
chart (https://www.datawrapper.de/_/oWrIp/). However, there are some caveats that need to be understood: retirement age is for many countries not a fixed date. It changes with age, it will be changing over the next few years, and there are intricate rules almost everywhere. So here I usually captured the earliest date, or the most common date. Dataviz of this kind is hard, but I hope this gives something to think about – especially those countries that seem to have very close retirement age and life expectancy.
Feel free to share, but do share with these caveats if you do.

What is geocoding?
Geocoding is translating between geo coordinates (latitude, longitude) and human place descriptions (addresses, placenames, etc). There are two kinds of geocoding:
Forward geocoding
: address to coordinates
Reverse geocoding
: coordinates to address
More smart phones and tracking devices means more geodata is being created than ever before. Geocoding is a first step in processing that data into useful information.
In the coming weeks this series will look at the challenges around geocoding
.
At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we run a highly available, simple to use, worldwide, geocoding API based on open datasets like OpenStreetMap. Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

Why is open geodata important? What's the difference between open and closed data?
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)Proprietary geodata from private services like Google are widely used, but come with licenses that severely restrict how you can use the data. Restrictions include:
don't allow storing (caching) beyond a certain time period, and require deletion when you stop being a customer
limit which maps you can use to display the geodata
require a significantly higher cost to use behind a firewall or in desktop software
no clarity on when or if data will be refreshed or corrected
Open data, like that returned by
the OpenCage geocoding API (https://opencagedata.com/), means:
store data as long as you like
display on any map
use publicly or behind a firewall
fix errors when you find them
As a final bonus, because the data is free (no cost), our service is also
much more affordable (https://opencagedata.com/reducing-your-google-geocoding-costs).
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

A plan for accessible maps
Benjy Stanton: "
Designing
accessible interactive maps (https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/blog/a-plan-for-accessible-maps/)is hard. I don’t think I could point to any single thing that I’ve worked on that covers all of the things mentioned here. But, if I was going to start a brand new project, with plenty of time to get things right, this is where I’d start.
The following isn't perfect, I'm really just sharing my workings so far. I hope that if you can see something is wrong or missing, you'll point it out. I’ll definitely iterate and add to this post in future.

Playing With Gpx Data from Strava
Hey, this one is by me :) I wanted to make a dataviz of all my 2020 lockdown runs, and I ended up data wrangling both in QGIS (including an interesting application of processing tools in order to create the colouring of areas by local authority) and Python/Jupyter. The write-up is on

Investigating Social Vulnerability to Extreme Heat: Heat Islands and Climate Shelters in Urban Contexts: The Case of Bologna
A team of researchers at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento (Italy): "
n this
article (https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/14/1/17)we present three instruments: (1) a social vulnerability to extreme heat index to identify the areas of a city (and populations thereof) more vulnerable to extreme heat due to climate change (heat islands); (2) a new overall fragility index that incorporates social vulnerability to extreme heat as well as socioeconomic indicators; and (3) a climate shelter index (CSI) to identify areas within a city that can provide relief from extreme heat based on green and blue solutions. We elaborated these three indexes to measure social vulnerability to extreme heat in the municipality of Bologna, which serves as this article’s case study. By analyzing the connections between social vulnerability to extreme heat and several socio-demographic variables in Bologna, we found that a decrease in income is significantly correlated with an increase in social vulnerability to extreme heat in urban contexts. A comparison between our new overall fragility index and the existing index adopted by the municipality of Bologna (Indice di fragilità, Comune di Bologna) showed that about 75% of the statistical areas observed are worse off when social vulnerability to extreme heat is also considered. Considering social vulnerability to extreme heat shows vulnerabilities in a city (here: Bologna) that the pre-existing index did not consider. These findings and our new indexes can support the Bologna administration (and other local administrations) in addressing the consequences of climate change for their most vulnerable residents.

"
3.9 micron data from the GOES-16 East and GOES-18 West satellites on the January 2025 Southern California fires. We download the reprojected data from UW SSEC's RealEarth program. Each image is 128x128 pixels, centered at (34.1, -118.4). Each pixel is 1.0 km. The satellites measure the temperatures of the topmost infrared-opaque region in the atmosphere, which may exaggerate the extent of fires from heated smoke, or hide the extent from cloud cover. You can
see (https://github.com/xingyzt/fire)how quickly the fires initially grow — up to a square mile every minute at first — fueled by dry vegetation and strong winds. This shows the extreme difficulty of containment.

Addresses, and why they can be a nightmare.
Good news:
Open, global datasets like OpenStreetMap make getting lots geodata easier than ever.
Bad news:
Now you have to sort through it, which can be an i18n nightmare.
Example:
Given this geodata for a location in Spain - which address would a normal person expect?
"components": {
    "ISO_3166-1_alpha-2": "ES",
    "ISO_3166-1_alpha-3": "ESP",
    "ISO_3166-2": [
        "ES-CT",
        "ES-B"
    ],
    "_category": "building",
    "_normalized_city" : "Barcelona",
    "_type": "building",
    "city": "Barcelona",
    "continent" : "Europe",
    "country" : "Spain",
    "country_code" : "es",
    "county" : "Barcelon\u00e8s",
    "county_code" : "B",
    "house_number" : "66-68",
    "political_union" : "European Union",
    "postcode" : "08017",
    "province" : "Barcelona",
    "quarter" : "les Tres Torres",
    "road" : "Carrer de Calatrava",
    "state" : "Catalonia",
    "state_code" : "CT",
    "suburb" : "Sarri\u00e0 - Sant Gervasi"        
},
At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we’ve
open-sourced the templates (https://github.com/OpenCageData/address-formatting)we use to convert address data into well formatted strings for the 240+ territories around the world, so we know the correct answer is
Carrer de Calatrava, 66-68, 08017 Barcelona, Spain
. This is just one of many small steps we’ve taken to make developer’s lives easier.
Anyone looking for an entertaining view of the technical complexity of addresses should read “
Falsehoods programmers believe about addresses (https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/)”. Meanwhile, in the category of not sure whether to laugh or cry, we have last year's news of

No sports for the next 4 weeks, thought, which means I've been binge-watching the Australian Open on TV and realising how much data now goes into tennis. The linesmen have all disappeared, replaced by electronics. Not sure I like this (given I wanted to get onto a course to become one ahah).

Build or Buy? Should you try to create your own geocoder?
Welcome to part four of our series on geocoding.
Given freely available opensource software, and open data like OpenStreetMap, should you run your own geocoder? Or should you pay a service like ours to host the geocoding software for you?
The whole point of open data is that you can do it yourself, right
?
The short answer is that yes, you can run, or even write, your own geocoder. Unqiue technical requirements may mean it makes sense to craft your own custom service, but most people prefer to leave it experts and get on with their real work.
Our geocoding API
aggregates many different open data sources (https://opencagedata.com/credits)and provides enterprise level reliability. One factor we see many people overlook: setting up the software is one thing, keeping the underlying data current is another. Put another way:
building is easy, maintaining is hard
. OSM alone gets 4-5 million edits per day. Still, as a developer myself and long-time OSM contributor, I understand the inclination to get your hands dirty. Hopefully it helps put you at ease to know that we’re
doing our part to give back to the open data and open source geo software community (https://opencagedata.com/about).
Finally, rest easy knowing that if you ever need to the data and code is all there for you to dive into. That’s
the real power of open-source and open data
.
Have a project that will need geocoding? See our
geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

Mercator: extreme

The map you see is the Mercator projection.
But
unlike a standard Mercator projection, you can substitute any point on earth as the "pole". (https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/)(The initial view shows Boston as the pole point.
Furthermore, this map cuts off much, much closer to the poles than normal, allowing you to see many more orders of magnitude of distortion.
Because this yields a map several times taller than it is wide, it is shown sideways from its usual orientation.
"
You can set your home address as the pole point and see what happens. The one below is centred on the UK Houses of Parliament. The code is also available.

It's AMA o'clock! This is the Quantum of Sollazzo Ask Me Anything section.
Here's a few questions and answers you asked me over the past month.
Jessica Nichols asks "
What was your most memorable data related
thing
from 2024?
".
One must surely be the advances we've witnesses in LLMs and the impact they're having on services, the future of work, and the value, or perceived value, of companies. The latter point is particularly hot, just look at the chart of the NVIDIA stock value below. Throughout 2024, NVIDIA more than doubled its value thanks to its perceived value increasing due to progress in tools like ChatGPT and other Western world based AI companies that create LLMs that are trained using NVIDIA chips; however, in early 2025, it very quickly lost over 20% because of news from China, where DeepSeek seems to have released models that can be trained much more cheaply, and using hardware than is cheaper to source than that produced by NVIDIA. The impact of these fluctuations on society, investments, pension funds, etc, is huge. The thing about it is that the value produced by these impact is not easy to determine, and often doesn't translate to profitability.
But I also have to say that I've been trying some of these tools and they are indeed a massive productivity injection. The one I've worked the most is Anthropic's Claude, which I've used as a pair programming buddy. While it often doesn't get everything right, you can conversationally reason about code, add tests, debug, seek alternatives. While I still don't think you can use the code it produces straight out of the box, I must recognise that it's making my coding more solid more quickly. It does feel like pair programming with someone who's oddly both less experienced on broader issues, but also pretty good at hands on wrangling.
Asun says "
I'm in my late forties, doing an MA in data science -- my background is computational linguistics -- because I thought it would be interesting work and I would learn useful tools (and so far, I was right). I would like to work on a freelance basis rather than as a company employee -- possibly together with other sources of income, at least to begin with.
I plan on working on my own projects and will continue to learn (always), but I would be very grateful for any advice you could give me
."
Well, I'm not sure I can give more advice than what Asun is already doing pretty well: learn something you enjoy, see the connections with other areas of practice, offer them whenever you see a "you-shaped" hole. If you can afford financially to sacrifice a few days a month to self-development by creating your own projects, that will work out pretty well over time. When, in 2011, I created
LiveRugby (https://liverugbyapp.puntofisso.net/), I thought it would be a hit and I'd make a regular income out of it. Not just I made no money at all – if anything, I lost some! But it set me on a course to use what I learned to create other sources of data-driven income (and, in a way, I wouldn't be in my current job if I hadn't tried launching that app). My only advice is: aim for the star, but accept that failure is part of the journey. Ask yourself: what could be the value of doing this, if it fails? If you have an answer, keep doing it.
Stefano Gatti (author of this
splendid newsletter (https://stefanogatti.substack.com/)) asks "
What's your opinion on Open Data movement in Uk, in Europe and in USA? I'd like in particular to know your point of view about the impact on society and business.
"
We could write a book together about this, Stefano. The Open Data movement became mainstream at a time of political and societal change sweeping through the world, after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the global financial crisis had shown two major points: first, the value of transparency in helping challenge and scrutinise power; second, the power of data and technology in understanding a problem and taking action towards it. Has it had impact? Some, for sure. For example, in the UK, we have some
excellent monitoring of river levels thanks to open data (https://www.gaugemap.co.uk/). But I think that open data was, in many ways, a disappointing revolution. This is in part because we, as activists, didn't manage to truly win the argument of embedding data and open data into processes (well, I'm working on this in Government now, but in my case this is hardly open data as it's centred on individual-level data). But an important part of that disappointment stems from the fact societal problems are becoming more difficult, more global, changing more frequently – data is equally growing, becoming more complex, harder to process without infrastructure. Yes, we can access satellite imagery to monitor fires in California; but not everyone has the ability and capability to process data like this at home, it's not like an Excel spreadsheet to check where grant funding is going (important, but with a much lower barrier). This means that the ideal of dumping a dataset on a portal and expecting civic society to help is harder to achieve.
However, the positive impact of Open Data as a movement is how it allowed people to consider that more collaboration, communication, engagement, and evidence-driven processes, can create better outcomes. I always quote the
words of former Permanent Secretary Clare Moriarty (https://www.fda.org.uk/news/clare-moriarty-women-into-leadership-speech/): "
It started with a commitment to open data which led to us releasing 10,000 data sets in a year, including some truly massive ones. But opening our data was at most half the issue. More important was the effect it had on open working among colleagues across many organisations in the Defra group, and with a range of external partners from universities to charities to commercial organisations.
That led to interesting discussions about how open government relates to accountability, and also to user-centred design. It took us into how we can be more open as individuals, sharing a bit more about ourselves as a way of making connections with others: building respect and trust. Open has all sorts of dimensions.
"
Finally, Oli asks: "
Who would win in a fight on a beach, a bear or a giant squid? Please show your workings
". It's Saturday morning and I haven't properly caffeinated yet, so I've asked Claude. It thinks that a squid is immediately at a disadvantage on the beach but would win in the water. However, I take issue at the suggestion that a squid's weaponry would be good:
No, thanks. But thanks.

@puntofisso.bsky.social (https://bsky.app/profile/puntofisso.bsky.social)I've done a thing...
Hey, you've probably heard of my interactive web app
Parli-N-Grams (https://parli-n-grams.puntofisso.net/), which charts the frequency of words and phrases in debates at the UK Parliament. Originally, it was for the House of Commons, and over time I added the House of Lords. In January 2025 I've also added new datasets from the amazing mySociety – TheyWorkForYou archives which allow searches through Written Answers and Written Ministerial Statements in both chambers.

A visual timeline of the collision between a passenger plane and a Black Hawk helicopter in DC
Soph Warnes and others at the CNN have done this amazing piece of
visual work (https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/30/us/maps-plane-helicopter-crash-dca-dg/index.html), and released it very quickly.
It's really a great explainer of the tragic accident on the Potomac river.
PRESENTATION: The State of Video Gaming in 2025
I'm not particularly into gaming, but this
slide deck (https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025)by producer Matthew Ball is really interesting and comes with a good eye openers. As you might have heard, the gaming market soared until 2021, when it suddenly stalled and, to most, surprisingly, stalled. The 220 slides (!) explain why, with a few surprises. The chart below, for example – on slide 75.
With thanks to Colin Davis for putting this on my radar.

Geocoding is just the first step
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)Most data projects involve tedious cleaning and enriching before the data can actually be "used".
At OpenCage, we are firm believers that
laziness is one of the virtues of a great developer (https://thethreevirtues.com/). We’ve thought a lot about making geocoding with open data dead simple, but also how to simplify the total journey to using the data.
Our geocoding API returns "
annotations
"
- extra information about the location that developers might find useful, thus saving work.
An example is EU NUTS codes, standard codes commonly used for linking datasets and statistical analysis. Looking up the relevant codes for a region is not particularly complex, but it is the kind small tasks that need to be done correctly (and maintained) in a larger data processing project. So, as a simplification for our users, we already return the correct codes as an annotation.
As an example, a request to the OpenCage geocoder for
52.387, 9.733
(in northern Germany) returns the annotation
"NUTS": {
  "NUTS0": {
    "code": "DE"
  },
  "NUTS1": {
    "code": "DE9"
  },
  "NUTS2": {
    "code": "DE92"
  },
  "NUTS3": {
    "code": "DE929"
  }
},
We also return many other types of information, for example: the local timezone, calling code, currency information, other reference systems like geohash, what3words, MGRS, US FIPS cdes, Maidenhead, the time of sunrise and sunset, the qibla angle, and
much more (https://opencagedata.com/api).

geocoding buyer's guide (https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-compare-and-test-geocoding-services)for an overview of all the factors to consider when choosing between geocoding services.

New Frontiers: The Origins and Content of New Work, 1940–2018∗
Ok, this is a chunky (134 pages!)academic paper PDF (https://poid.lse.ac.uk/PUBLICATIONS/abstract.asp). I'll be honest: I haven't read it all. But it comes with quite a few quotable points and charts, including the one below.
"
We find, first, that the majority of current employment is in new job specialties introduced after 1940, but the locus of new work creation has shifted—from middle-paid production and clerical occupations over 1940–1980, to high-paid professional and, secondarily, low-paid services since 1980.

The "exposure to import competition" is, obviously, an interesting concept for our times.
What is the unemployment rate in the US right now?
USA Facts (https://usafacts.org/answers/what-is-the-unemployment-rate/country/united-states/): "
About 4.1% in December 2024. That's a 0.3 percentage point increase from a year before. The unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the labor force who are actively looking for work but not currently employed. It's a common way to measure the health of the job market and economy.

Geocoding at scale
(https://gist.github.com/freyfogle/3fd76a6710e724db9e616f5d84b951fb)In our final installment in our series about using open data for geocoding we contemplate the challenges of geocoding at scale. What are the issues you face when you have many hundreds of thousands or even millions of coordinates or addresses to work on daily? At
OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/)we serve numerous customers in this category, and a common question that comes up is whether an API based solution can handle that type of scale.
An API-based solution, managed by experts, is almost always the most reliable and most affordable way to develop such an on-going system, as otherwise you will soon be spending a lot of valuable developer time making sure your geodata is staying current. As anyone who has worked with software can confirm: “
Building is easy, maintaining is hard
”.
Nevertheless, there are challenges that come with depending on any external service, one of course being network availability. At OpenCage we have multiple, fully-redundant data centers, and the availability of our service is independently and publicly monitored by a third party (current and past operational status can be seen at
status.opencagedata.com (https://status.opencagedata.com/)).
Still, even with a highly-available service, some customers worry about the “cost” of crossing the internet to an external service. The fastest API query is the one you don’t even make; a smart caching strategy can go a long way to reducing usage. Because our geocoding API is built on open data you can cache the results as long as you like, and we’ve
published a few tips and points to consider (https://opencagedata.com/api).
We hope you’ve enjoyed our series on the issues around geocoding with open data. While we’ve used our service as the example, we believe many of the concepts and considerations will apply regardless of the data processing tools and services you are building on. If you have questions regarding anything we discussed,
please get in touch (https://opencagedata.com/contact).

In the past, authors may have had to rely on hand-drawn maps or simple digital illustrations.

Most U.S. counties have little to no local news sources
Sara Fischer (Axios): "
An uptick in newspaper closures this year has left more than half of the nation's 3,143 counties — or 55 million people — with just

Europe is short of General Practitioners
Adrian Burtin for Voxeurop/EDJNet: "
Europe is facing a
shortage of doctors (https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/cp_data_news/europe-is-short-of-gps/), across all specialisations. The deficit of general practitioners is a particular problem. Family doctors are ageing and unevenly distributed, and their profession is struggling to attract new recruits.

For comparison, you can find some data about England

What is the current inflation rate in the US?
Historically (https://usafacts.org/answers/what-is-the-current-inflation-rate/country/united-states)speaking, it's not that bad. The 1920s were absolutely terrifying. USAFacts reports. Also, look at their other
article (https://usafacts.org/articles/why-might-prices-feel-high-if-inflation-is-slowing)on the same topic.
No, 150-Year-Olds Aren’t Collecting Social Security Benefits

Elon Musk claims to have found rampant fraud in the Social Security Administration. There’s a much simpler
explanation (https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/).

TL;DR: COBOL. It's interesting to understand the impact of legacy software in this hotly debated issue.

Mapping climate policy: navigating context-specific language (Part I)Climate Policy Radar's Kalyan Dutia and Anne Jelmar Sietsma
built (https://www.climatepolicyradar.org/latest/mapping-language-part-one)a
tool (https://maps.labs.climatepolicyradar.org/)to let users create maps looking at use of different climate terminology across the world in climate policy.
"
Finding all climate policies relevant to a particular topic is not a simple task. This is doubly difficult where language and terminology carry political sensitivity. The Climate Policy Radar app already contains these, so selecting text based on keywords is an obvious first step. However, where language is often very context-dependent, we often need to combine multiple keywords in order to gain a representative overview. Even the phrase "most vulnerable" is controversial in and of itself. Some people, including many academics, find it a useful shorthand for a host of different risk factors; others consider it disempowering (even offensive) because of its allusion to "weakness". We need to be very deliberate in choosing our keywords, so we help our users find what they need, without accidentally entrenching historic discrimination or alienating users.

The data newsletter by
@puntofisso (http://www.puntofisso.net).
Hello, regular readers and welcome new ones :) This is Quantum of Sollazzo, the newsletter about all things data. I am Giuseppe Sollazzo, or
@puntofisso (http://twitter.com/puntofisso). I've been sending this newsletter since 2012 to be a summary of all the articles with or about data that captured my attention over the previous week. The newsletter is and will always (well, for as long as I can keep going!) be free, but you're welcome to become a friend via the links below.
Wow, THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER 600
! I am in year 13 of sending Quantum. Why do I keep going? It's because I keep learning a lot by writing this newsletter. It's  been a fun adventure thus far. I started in 2012 in what looked like an entirely different world. It was before the London Olympics, and before I had "data" in my job title. This newsletter has allowed me to engage with some amazing people working in data in all sectors. While data journalists and public sector data folks have always been the largest reader cohort, it has sometimes expanded in unexpected directions.
It was through readers of this newsletter that I got invited to speak at
csv,conf,v7 (https://puntofisso.net/csvconf2023)(thank you Naomi! And look below for an announcement on csv,conf,v9) and
TRGCON (https://puntofisso.net/trgcon24/)(¡gracias, David!); it was through readers of this newsletter that I was offered an interesting gig with
PowerToChange (https://puntofisso.medium.com/my-report-on-best-practice-for-local-data-initiatives-313d12f83865); it was through readers of this newsletter that I learned more about data projects that I had missed (Guy and Peter have been particularly consistent over the years – thank you!). 
I've had a few people supporting me over time, including as sponsors – some of which are returning sponsors, such as ProofRed, OpenCageData, and the EDJNet. Thank you.
To all you 4,000+ readers: thank you. I will keep going for as long as I keep learning. Thank you for encouraging me and sharing your views with me.

Data Art Gallery
Data art (https://nrennie.rbind.io/data-art/)(or data-driven art) lies somewhere between data visualisation and generative art. Where data visualisation aims to accurately represent data to communicate insights, generative art uses algorithms to create unique visuals which often incorporate randomness or predefined rules. Like generative art, the primary aim of data art is artistic impact, rather clarity or analysis. Data art may in fact be though of as a sub-genre of generative art. It allows people to consider visual patterns in data without the bias of knowing what the data is, and can spark conversations on important topics. This gallery displays a variety of data art examples, built with a range of open source tools.

What tips or recommendations do you have for young colleagues who are new to the field of data journalism?
This is an easy one and a hard one. Things are in a flurry in the world of data visualization, and there are many challenges in data journalism. So in terms of training: go broad, try and be
t-shaped (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills), don't get fixated on one piece of technology, one framework, one way of visualizing things. Try and ask questions, then develop answers to those questions. Doing this will require several steps: finding the data, which might mean accepting that the data might not be quite right, and in turn will make you either change your questions accordingly to some that are answerable, find a good proxy, or become an activist and create or ensure the data you need is available; processing the data;making it visually appealing; and learning how to avoid potential pitfalls. Learn the story of William Du Bois and
how he made his own census (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exhibit_of_American_Negroes). I spoke about some of these issues in
my talk at TRGCON (https://vimeo.com/1039460710/04c182b2f5)last year (photo below).
What does your desk setup look like? Any fave tech?
I try and be as tidy as I can, and fail. I have an automated fully standing desk with a wide curved monitor, a laptop stand, and two keyboards (a Magic Keyboard for my Mac, and a KLIM Chroma for my work laptop). I have put some backlights behind the screen, but it's just a test for now, I need to get something more professional. I also have a camera light that doubles up as a desk lamp. This is where I write most of my newsletter issues on a Saturday morning, sipping coffee.
If you're wondering what the red cable is, it's a usb connection from my laptop to my ham radio(s) on the right. I use it when I want to communicate via FT8, a digital radio mode.

Quantifying Geospatial in the Common Crawl Corpus
Data scientist Ilya Ilyankou et al. have published this intriguing
research paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04952)that looks at how widespread a given type of geospatial information is (e.g. longitude/latitude coordinates) in Common Crawl, the big dataset used to train LLMs. As he explained to me: "
We know LLMs have decent geospatial knowledge & reasoning but didn't know how widespread geospatial is in the pre-training data (Common Crawl being the most prominent one). Turns out there is a lot! Between 1 in 5 to 1 in 6 web pages contain either coordinates or addresses or both.
"
He adds: "
And there is quite a few annotated GPX tracks which we used to compile into an activity description <> MultiLineString pairings (multimodality at its finest). So CC can be used as a big free source for smaller, higher quality geospatial datasets. Who would have thought.

Why the modern data stack matters in the AI age

In 2021 through early 2023, the data space and specifically “The Modern Data Stack” was arguably the highest energy, most dynamic area of the tech sector, and certainly dominated the discourse.

The mystery on my mind has been -
what is the connection here? (https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/why-the-modern-data-stack-matters)Is it just an accident of history that right before we got AI systems that actually work at scale, we were focusing on centralizing and modeling our data?

Let's say the "badness" of a variable name is: "how badly named something is" multiplied by "how often you see the bad name". I think the
worst variable name (https://johnscolaro.xyz/blog/data-sucks)in all of programming is the word "data".

Deep Learning is Not So Mysterious or Different
NYU Professor Andrew Gordon Wilson: "
Deep neural networks are often seen as different from other model classes by defying conventional notions of generalization. Popular examples of anomalous generalization behaviour include benign overfitting, double descent, and the success of overparametrization.
We argue (https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02113)that these phenomena are not distinct to neural networks, or particularly mysterious. Moreover, this generalization behaviour can be intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized using long-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. We present soft inductive biases as a key unifying principle in explaining these phenomena: rather than restricting the hypothesis space to avoid overfitting, embrace a flexible hypothesis space, with a soft preference for simpler solutions that are consistent with the data. This principle can be encoded in many model classes, and thus deep learning is not as mysterious or different from other model classes as it might seem. However, we also highlight how deep learning is relatively distinct in other ways, such as its ability for representation learning, phenomena such as mode connectivity, and its relative universality.

Floods are the most common natural disaster. Their frequency has more than

JPMorgan Chase then acquired the startup for $175 million. ... I'm coming back to this over the weekend because

Measuring clouds... okay, cloudy water (and air)"
In the tail end of 2024, the water system that serves NYC had declared a drought warning because we didn't get enough rain for most of the Fall season. Since then, out of idle curiosity I
check (https://www.counting-stuff.com/measuring-clouds-okay-cloudy-water-and-air/)the official page for the current reservoir levels. The drought warning was lifted in early January since we had a lot of big snow events upstate this winter.

But also: "
Why must the references be remade on a very regular basis? Because there's a process called "Ostwald ripening" that happens to suspensions of solids and liquids where small particles will, over time, clump together and form larger crystals or bodies because clumping puts the system into a better (lower energy) thermodynamic state.
